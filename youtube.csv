k7ngnWJ6Hks,Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder,This talk was given at a local TEDx event  produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer  educator  and multimedia designer. During the day  Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado  the children’s collaborative art center Reel Kids  the City of Longmont  and as an independent educator. At night  he composes  solders  choreographs  and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen’s works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard  his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles  squiggles  arrows  and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen’s music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx  x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading  TEDx is a program of local  self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event  TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local  self-organized events are branded TEDx  where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program  but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations),Art and Music

Soq4M_hu-Nc,Aboriginal Art and Music,A quick look at some aboriginal art .. All images taken from google images . The audio is from something called Songs From The Northern Territory 4Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt Artist/Collector: Alice Moyle Label Information: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD Media Type: CD Year: Recorded 1963; Released 1997 Availability: AIATSIS Notes: For the purpose of music description  Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore islands; the eastern sector  extending along the coast as far south as the Roper River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt. The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala  together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently  they have become known as the Yolngu  from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language  Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters  Warnindilyakwa  a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island  is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them  for instance  with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable  meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT)  or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables  a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example  bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13)  only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice  a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall  swoop down  or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short  patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that  whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less  emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .,Art and Music
daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Schönberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years  a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Schönberg in his "Three Piano Pieces". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here  selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Schönberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces  Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure  cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power  as in the massively congested opening  to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky  with whom he had close  contacts  when he likened such music to developments in painting -"without architecture... an ever-changing  unbroken succession of colours  rhythms and moods." (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the "Der Blaue Reiter"(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Schönberg indicate  Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted  Kandinsky theorized that  for instance  yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure  and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies  akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships  claiming  for example  that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants  including Wassily Kandinsky  Alexej von Jawlensky  Marianne von Werefkin  and native German artists  such as Franz Marc  August Macke and Gabriele Münter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914  fundamental to Expressionism  along with Die Brücke which was founded in 1905.All rights reserved to copyright owners.,Art and Music

Day For Night is currently the only confirmed U.S. date for New Order.Passes to the two day art and music festival will be available at 10AM on Thursday  October 8  via www.dayfornight.io. Two ticket levels will be made available. General Admission will give access to the art installations as well as all musical performances on three stages for the entire weekend at a price of $185. VIP tickets are limited and will include front of stage pit access with private bar  complimentary beverages and small plates  access to private lounge  rapid entry  and commemorative lanyard for $750. Thousands of blind pre-sale tickets sold out in less than 24 hours when the event was announced in early September. Curator Alex Czetwertynski explains  “The festival's title  “Day For Night ” provides the main key to understand the work being presented  as that space between day/night or light/dark is where our perception gets the blurriest. All of the artists in our roster will  in one way or another  transform our feeling of time  space  perspective  and place. They were chosen because of their common use of computational media to manipulate light  time  and sound. Their approaches to light and sound can be literal  or purely as a medium to reveal content.  And with the large scale canvas that Day for Night is offering these artists  we can only expect this audio-visual exchange to be a heightened sensorial experience.”With acres of immersive installations within the emerging field of digital art and performances by world-class musicians  each are curated not just for their musical talent but also the visual qualities of their stage presence  Day For Night seeks to redefine the festival experience and inspire attendees to re-examine the way they interact with and understand both art and music.,Art and Music

Xcmijqbd8kc,'Hey Bill Nye  What's the Evolutionary Purpose of Music and Art?',The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives  explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom  song and visual displays are great tools for  um  flirting.Read more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bill-nye-o...Follow Big Think here:YouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcomTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthinkTranscript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now  there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs  which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species  so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives  engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So  this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.,Art and Music
qBERpxQ5wwA,Ronnie Wood: Art and Music exhibition opens,On March 28th  Ronnie Wood: Art and Music opens at the William Benton Museum of Art at the University of Connecticut.  This exhibition features an exciting selection of early work as well as very recent work by Ronnie and includes a number of portraits of The Rolling Stones. Created from an insider's perspective  Ronnie portrays his colleagues  his friends  and band-mates  both in group portraits and individually  with an insight and intimacy not accessible to anyone else. Through line and colour  he deftly captures the creative energy of his musical world  showing us a view different from what we might see in the concert hall or arena. Ronnie Wood is one of those rare artists who can express himself through both music and the visual arts  eloquently and expertly.http://www.thebenton.org/exb_current....,Art and Music

d8VA7_qSC7U,With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.,"Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind  to make the world a better place."  ~ Jeff KoonsSomething I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago  my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men  woman  and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: "I could do this with video." Shortly after  I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started  please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes  housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness  and as you'll see in this vlog - art  music  and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year  With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA État d'Urgence Festival in Montreal  Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example  in this vlog  I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces.

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,The "one story" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story  but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new  mixed with the old  and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform  one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet  singer  composer  producer  and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path  seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25  released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film  about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film  focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition  held in The USA  The Philipines  The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company  El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007  in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net,Art and Music

Yhif28t47qk,Creativity Music for Writing  Art  Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats),Creativity Music for Writing  Art  Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats) MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...Using a combination of Theta  Alpha and Beta frequencies  this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits  encourage fluid  abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively  with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner  every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights  generate new & original ideas  contemplate a concept from various points of view  and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration  but to also analyse  organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study  you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track  we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios  as well as our partner channel  The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

CQ4gxP2NGiQ,Mathematics  Music  and Visual Art,Bridges 4: Mathematics  Music  and Visual ArtOur talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics  music  and visual arts  using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony  to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry  showing how elementary musical terms like “chord” and “voice leading” correspond to geometrical concepts like “vectors in an orbifold.” This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces  the development of styles  and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems  science  nature  and music  he combines computer code  traditional materials  and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida  Bangkok  and Amsterdam.Dmitri Tymoczko’s book A Geometry of Music is available from Oxford University Press  and his CDs Beat Therapy and Crackpot Hymnal are available from Bridge Records.

9RQ-Ha9JmpI,The Harlem Renaissance:  The Rise of African American Literature  Art  and Music,This short film  produced and created by Rob Johnson of San Rafael  CA   is an introduction to an interdisciplinary unit on the Music  Art  and Literature of the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance (also known as the Black Literary Renaissance and the New Negro Movement) refers to the flowering of African American cultural and intellectual life during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time  it was known as the "New Negro Movement"  named after the 1925 anthology The New Negro edited by Alain Locke. Centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City  the movement impacted urban centers throughout the United States. Across the cultural spectrum (literature  drama  music  visual art  dance) and also in the realm of social thought (sociology  historiography  philosophy)  artists and intellectuals found new ways to explore the historical experiences of black America and the contemporary experiences of black life in the urban North. Challenging white paternalism and racism  African-American artists and intellectuals rejected imitating the styles of Europeans and white Americans and instead celebrated black dignity and creativity. Asserting their freedom to express themselves on their own terms  they explored their identities as black Americans  celebrating the black culture that had emerged out of slavery  as well as cultural ties to Africa. The Harlem Renaissance had a profound impact not only on African-American culture but also on the cultures of the African diaspora. Afro-Caribbean artists and intellectuals from the British West Indies  who had migrated to New York in number  were part of the movement. Moreover  many French-speaking black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[1] Historians disagree as to when the Harlem Renaissance began and ended. It is unofficially recognized to have spanned from about 1919 until the early or mid 1930s. Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this "flowering of Negro literature"  as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance  is placed between 1924 (the year that Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression). In 1917 Hubert Harrison  "The Father of Harlem Radicalism " founded the Liberty League and The Voice  the first organization and the first newspaper of the "New Negro Movement". Harrison's organization and newspaper were political  but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had "Poetry for the People" and book review sections). In 1927  in the Pittsburgh Courier  Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the "Negro Literary Renaissance" notion overlooked "the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present"  and said the so-called "renaissance" was largely a white invention.

When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page  I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art  inspiration  and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay,Art and Music

WJaR7rJqKIk,Art and Incarceration:  Poetry  Theatre and Music in and about Captivity,For this interdisciplinary performance  Ensemble Pi presented music  text  and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration  the racial disparities it reveals  and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory  inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski’s minimalist masterpiece  Coming Together  composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian  the narrator for Coming Together  will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play  The Bullpen  based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time (1941)  composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz  Germany  capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison  while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq  and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission  as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of “socially conscious” compositions. In the past  the group has collaborated with visual artists  writers  journalists and actors – including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill – and have featured the music of John Harbison  Frederic Rzewski  Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media  fracking  the Apartheid  and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach  cello; Moran Katz  clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman  piano; Airi Yoshioka  violin; and Joseph Assadourian  actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt  percussion and Daniel Egan  trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions,Art and Music

lgGf6WuUQro,"Art and Music" by Art and Music,https://www.klbinternationalpublishin..."Art and Music" by Art and MusicLets be honest  Kasey Jones of Art and Music is currently not an award winning artist  songwriter or producer. If he had Record Company  Drug Cartel  Big Pharma  Government Military money he probably could be. Why? Because kids  you can buy your way to the top in this game we are all playing. Don't think you are a part of it? Think again and hit the books. So till the scales tip and above becomes below he will be frequently relocated to earth to fulfill his soul contract after numerous other glorious failed attempts.  He is passionate about making intimate and poignant songs using outdated and unreliable equipment in his living room. He's scrappy  hungry  skilled at burning bridges and primed to explode at any moment. Possibly implode. Art and Music's highly unanticipated second album “Who are They”  is a completely independent release. Jones produced  recorded  engineered and performed every instrument on this release  highlighting his versatility and broad musical scope. Further demonstrating his sheer insanity.One of the most exciting things about Art and Music is that Jones can exercise full creative control over every stage of the music-making experience  from conception to fruition!He blissfully watches mindless robot sheep perpetuate in consumer stupor  narrowly avoiding mental breakdowns most of the time. Money is a hoax  debt is slavery  media is manipulation  religion is controlled  the system is a lie and Art and Music is awesome!https://www.klbinternationalpublishin...,Art and Music

SDmdsuGr3KQ,Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music),Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction  so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time  but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in  but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing  yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out  you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune  there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her  she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes  the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all  but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune  even after cheating on her  but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now  I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children  located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai  a normal boy living a normal life  has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties  Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love  if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters  each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.,Art and Music

She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer  and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions  which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so  Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise  sound and music  and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.Adrian Shaw is part of Tate’s Learning department  working on the Young People’s Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990’s and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‘Late at Tate’  these events often explore the boundaries between music  performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician  and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google  he worked closely with rappers  authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records  focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians.

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer  who’s distinctive bright  surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie  Tame Impala  Grimes  Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work “explores themes of connectedness  the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.”This is an archived version of the 'Music meets Art' Hangout On Air that took place on 9 December 2013 at Tate Britain: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-...,Art and Music
ubzIznrnK-Y,Art and Music Collaboration,Art and music make a beautiful therapeutic collaboration. Lynette Melnyk is a contemporary abstract artist who interprets music in her art. Tom Conti is a musician and composer with a passion for music. The two artists have combined their talents to create this art and music therapy video “Through The Struggle”. This classical piece is composed by Tom Conti  and is one of 12 on his latest album  which is based upon the fact that we have physical and emotional reactions to certain musical progressions and patterns. Tom says of his music "The fact that we compose them to help individuals reduce stress  anxiety  restlessness and emotional imbalances in a very natural way is no coincidence.”See more of Lynette’s artwork at http://hhlimited.com/portfolio/Hear more of Tom’s compositions at https://contimusic.com,Art and Music

AV6IQ55GZ_0,Connecting Geometric Form of Art  Architecture  and Music,This research investigates the history of various art forms of religious structures from both Muslim and Catholic Empires of the Iberian Peninsula throughout the end of the Middle Ages in Spain. By investigating the fundamental geometric forms of both Islamic art and Gothic architecture  there is a connection between religious influence  visual creativity and architectural  structure that strengthens physical capacity to the human experience. Relating these two art forms to music theory provides an introduction to the progress of music sciences in the modern age; including Cymatics  a 20th century science of wave phenomenon that demonstrates various geometric shapes of frequencies and musical pitch. This interdisciplinary approach of visualizing the common geometric forms of art  architecture  and music questions the anticipatory influence and outlook of the arts for future generations.,Art and Music
X3Os6vJxpu0,Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music Collection,Classic Lute - Renaissance Art | Music CollectionMusic Player: UnknowImage: Artemisia Gentileschi (Self-Portrait)No Tracklist Avaiable.In the Renaissance era  the lute was the most popular instrument in the Western world. It became the symbol of the magic and power of music. The lute was the instrument of kings and queens  playing the sublime music of great composers. The lute was heard in the theatre in the incidental music of Shakespeare's plays. And the lute was heard by common people  playing the popular tunes of the day in pubs and on street corners.The lute is the descendent of the Arabic Oud which traveled into Europe during the time of the Crusades. From the beginning  the lute had a pear-shaped body  a rounded back made of separate strips of wood  and a bent-back pegbox.he Early Music movement of the late twentieth century saw a new generation of lutenists dedicated to rediscovering the old performance practices. The tremendous beauty  variety and color of Renaissance and Baroque lute music can now be heard in their performances. And the amazing musical flexibility of the lute is revealed through new compositions  written in a variety of styles. After two hundred years of neglect  the future of the lute once again looks bright.* The music published in this channel is exclusively dedicated to divulgation artwork and songs.Gathering people that like the genre and style.

bo1iPm_eiQI,Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation,University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering  devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1 000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression  Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation  they have built a computer model of the clarinet  entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed  they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive  more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

moNxwjHZfT8,Art and Music / L.McKennitt - Stolen Child / lyrics / instrumental COVER on Yamaha CVP-509,welcome to my new instrumental cover ( improvisation) "stolen child".poetry by William Butler Yeats...sung and performed by Loreena McKennitt..I played it my way...with strings piano and harp...hier meine Version von "stolen child" einem keltischen Lied..gespielt auf Yamaha CVP-509.Streicher u.Harfe....lyrics:Where dips the rocky mountains To a soft and winter lake There lies a frosty island Where flapping herons wake.With the sound of soothing rhyme Let me sing for you a time Of a world so far it seems Can be only found in dreams.CHORUS:Come away  O human child To the beauties of the wild Where your sorrows melt away For the worlds more full of weeping Than ye can understand.As the waves of moonlight beckon For you to join me there.As the soft  white jasmine petals Drift through the snowy air As the sounds of silence cease The melody of rest brings peace As the purring lions dance In the winter-tide brilliance As the sky above us glows.And no more our troubles find us In this land that's free of woes.CHORUSWhere the wandering waters fountain In the pools across the dale You can eye the reindeer prancing To their long forgotten tales.As they leap and jump and bound Our hearts beat to the sound Under frosted  ivory sky With their sparkling antlers high Their hoof-beats serenade As we ride across the glade Through the silvery  silken snow In a wintry wonderland With the brisk wind at our backs.Let me take you there...CHORUSAs you close your eyes in slumber May you take me by the hand.Let us go where joy and laughter Ne'r cease in that fair land.,Art and Music

There’s AAA titles with cinematic writing  photorealistic graphics and epic orchestral music on the one hand [footage of Assassin’s Creed]. Another good example is the “Super Mario Odyssey” world “Steam Gardens” with its funky vibes due to a coherent artistic feel of character design  graphics and audio.

N0u04EqNVjo,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,On the first episode of "The Art of Punk" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols  to the many coveted and collected gig flyers  singles  and band t-shirts  all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris  and bass player Chuck Dukowski  about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation  as well as the bands name  and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea  from the Red Hot Chili Peppers  about how the art  the music  and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length  with Henry Rollins  at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles  about all of the above and more. Created  directed  and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied'  Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols)  and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire)  The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon)  The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith)  and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists  the series includes intimate interviews with former band members  notable artists  and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra  Tim Biskup  Scott Campbell  Chuck Dukowski  Flea  Steve Olson  Penny Rimbaud  Henry Rollins  Owen Thornton  and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork  which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11  2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18  and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode  all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20,Art and Music

2MhjkAbF00U,Art x Music: Sound artist Haroon Mirza and Dave Maclean (Django Django),Sound artist Haroon Mirza discusses the relationship between fine art and electronic music with Dave Maclean  the drummer and producer of indie band Django Django who has recently remixed Mirza's sound works under the moniker of Jellyman to create a dancefloor track that has been released by The Vinyl Factory.Alongside Factory Floor who also reworked Mirza's experiments for release by The Vinyl Factory  Jellyman's remix explores the liminal space between art and music  which both Maclean and Mirza believe is more a matter of context than classification. Riffing on similar themes during this revealing conversation  Dave and Haroon discuss the role of musicians in gallery spaces  the aesthetics of Kraftwerk and Detroit techno and the ways in which Haroon's turntable experiments reflect a broader trend in DIY DJ culture to doctor and modify records to create live loops and samples.To read more about the remix collaborations and hear both tracks  click here.To order a copy of Jellyman's remix  visit our shop.,Art and Music

fLgFtLLld4E,Math + Art = Music | Justin  Davis | TEDxProvidence,From the foundation of exchanging knowledge through communication  Justin weaves dancing  music  and art into the conversation with his talk turned performance. Justin Davis is a multi-talented performing artist who specializes in music  dance  and poetry. In 2011 Davis became cofounder and president of SPOKEN  a Rhode Island College student club for spoken-word poets and other artists. He also performs original songs and covers before live audiences throughout the State of Rhode Island and teaches dance throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

v-toMaehfmQ,Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village,When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists  transporting the dynamic street culture  living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions  workshops  festivals  performances  and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources  empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin  a multi-media installation artist  as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists  like all New Orleanians  struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation  leading our artists  culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America’s Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts. His America's Got talent performances were viewed by more than 40 million people on YouTube alone!"The popularity amongst Children across America following my viral appearances really inspired me  That I've been given an opportunity to be a good roll model for kids. Thats a great reason to wake up in morning" -Wolverton"My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1 000 years ago all art  performance  music  and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions  Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question "what it means to be human." His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

Thank you so much to the community for the support and kind words  they mean the absolute world to me!Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRoleSO this piece took research to pull off  I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish  Hungarian  etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.,Art and Music

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care  and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the "invisible hand" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

bxhPwMNZpgY,Wingmakers Music & Art,There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy  almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work  for me  has spiritual meaning  yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about  I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes  a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance  it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA  DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them "gods." This is an ongoing  unfolding project designed by it's creators  the Lyricus teaching order  to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart.

The city emerges2.  Emperor Charles IV and the golden age of Bohemia3.  Jan Hus  Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and  uniquely  has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches  palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However  often overlooked  Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries  in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and  at the other end of the time spectrum  the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague’s history from its origins in the ninth century up to today  while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures  relevant excerpts of Prague’s musical tradition – from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music  Smetana and Dvorak – will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

P5kHf0LhIm8,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.,How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.In this video  I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights  I recommend what I call creative mod. Then  when you actually create  you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up  but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side  there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.,Art and Music

I prefer draw from observation:meaning realistic drawing. Project was to listen to some music and interpret colors and abstract forms from the music. I chose my friend Eli's song 'Ukulele Fun' that he put together one day when he decided to pick up the uke and cello (crazy talented musician)But as I see stories through music  this proved difficult; I don't see blobs  I see people and scenes. But I did my best to try and turn my brain off. Thought it would be less of a chore if I was filming it  because everything looks better in fast forward motion!! :}so here ya go/..,Art and Music

In front of the TEDxLausanneWomen he honors a great woman in history. Franc Bouroullec is a Switzerland-based artist who has for the past 20 years sought  through the simple stroke of his paintbrush  to purify the subject of his paintings in a quest to touch upon their very essence. This world-renowned artist is regularly coveted across a variety of industries  including fashion (creating t-shirts for Tommy Hilfiger)  painting promotional previews for internationally acclaimed films (such as Love Actually and Quantum of Solace)  painting ‘live’ at events (ranging from royal birthdays to global events)  to name but a few. Today  exposing his workshop creations to the public eye is a way of telling a story. At the same time Franck Bouroullec continues to explore other art forms to ensure that his association with a specific technique does not limit the workings of his imagination.

kfBvz2rG-NI,Nina Burmi sings Thumri | Vocal and tabla | Indian Classical Music,#darbarfestival | Nina Burmi uses her smooth three-octave vocal range to explore the thumri style - a semi-classical genre intimately connected with dance  poetry  and drama.|*| Explore the finest Indian classical music and dance by signing up to our newsletter at: http://www.darbar.org/newsletter  and watch full length exclusive concerts in pristine HD on the Darbar Player: http://www.darbar.org/darbarplayer---------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the music:Thumri is a sensuous ‘light classical’ style  originating in Uttar Pradesh. The word is derived from the Hindi ‘thumakna’  meaning ‘to walk with dancing steps so as to make the ankle-bells tinkle’  and the genre remains closely connected with dance and drama. Ragas are treated more flexibly  and songs are often devotional  romantic  or even erotic in nature. Lyrics have a central role  often being based on folk tales or classical poetry  and commonly depicting the separation of lovers  or myths of Lord Krishna.Nina Burmi sings in the Kirana gharana style  tackling khayal  thumri  bhajan  and other forms. Currently living in the UK  she trained under the esteemed husband-wife pairing of Dilshad Khan and Parveen Sultana  and combines the latter’s wide vocal range with a more sparsely ornamented approach. In this song she is joined by top accompanists  with lyrics describing the tension and sorrow of a lover who is separated from Lord Krishna.Recorded for Darbar Festival 2006-Nina Burmi (vocal)-Ramesh Mishra (sarangi)-Sanju Sahai (tabla)Darbar believes in the power of Indian classical arts to stir  thrill and inspire. Through shared experiences and digital connectivity we ensure that one of the world’s finest art forms reaches the widest possible audience. Founded in 2006  we deliver premium quality live events  music education  broadcasts and online engagement through promoting artistic innovation and creative technology.

RheSKxNyOL8,Burning Man 2017: 70 000-strong expected to attend desert art and music festival - TomoNews,BLACK ROCK DESERT  NEVADA — The Burning Man festival is here once again as hipsters from across the country start to litter the deserts of Nevada to play in the sand and use some dust. The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70 000 people are expected to show up this year. Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1 200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists  off-the-wall families  high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. Elon Musk  Jeff Bezos  Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. Since then  it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival  all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching — especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.----------------------------------------­---------------------Go to https://www.patreon.com/tomonews and become a Patron now TomoNews is now on Patreon and we've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

ZY6h3pKqYI0,Auditory Illusions: Hearing Lyrics Where There Are None,Was looking for a midi for a project  but I couldn't find the one I needed. Came across a website that promised to convert MP3s to midis  so I figured I'd give it a shot. Aside from the fact that the result sounded like a piano factory exploding  I also could have sworn I heard sung lyrics in it  even though the only midi track was a piano. Not sure how the converter works  but I guess the way vocals are recreated via piano is similar enough to the real song for our brains to mentally fill in the words where there aren't any. Maybe? Pianos usually don't talk.Let me know how well you hear the lyrics  if at all  and what other songs you tried!Stuff I used:Converter- http://www.ofoct.com/audio-converter/...3D Midi visualizer- http://sourceforge.jp/projects/miditr...Midi instrument editor - http://www.synthfont.com/The midis I made from the video: https://www.mediafire.com/?cds9m6ss88...,Art and Music

4v9G2ArswUs,Food in Sri Lanka - 1.5 KG MONSTER Crab Curry (Family Recipe) in Colombo  Sri Lanka!,Best of Sri Lanka food tour with The Hungry Tourist: https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lCOLOMBO  SRI LANKA - Sri Lankan food is known for crabs  and you’ll find some of the best mud crabs you’ll ever try in Sri Lanka. One of the top places to eat Sri Lankan crab curry is The Station  a seafood restaurant and bar along the ocean in Colombo. During out best of Sri Lankan food tour (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....)  this was the first meal we had  and it was outstanding.I met up with Uchith (https://www.instagram.com/uchith/)  Nick (https://www.instagram.com/nimz_gd/)  and Lakki (https://www.instagram.com/lakkiw/)  who showed me the restaurant and took me to the kitchen to watch as they made their entire family recipe for Sri Lankan crab curry  using huge 1.5 kg. Sri Lankan mud crabs. It was fascinating and a learning experiences to watch all the different steps and the complicated ingredients used in their recipe.As I kept watching the Sri Lankan crab curry being made  I could hardly contain my excitement or mouth juices!Our entire group came  and they started bringing out more dishes - not just the Sri Lankan crab curry  but river prawns fried in black pepper  and spiny lobster hollowed out and re-added to its shell. It was stunningly good. Along with Sri Lankan food  The Station also has a few of their own unique  Sri Lankan fusion seafood dishes  including favorites like hot butter squid.Sri Lankan crab curry - we had one pan of their original Sri Lankan family recipe crab curry  and one pan of their extra spicy crab curry. Both were outstanding  but I loved the original for the spice blend and balance and how all the juices soaked up into the crab  it was outstanding. The Sri Lankan food and crab curry was outstanding  the people  our entire group  and the owners of The Station are incredible people as well. Thank you to The Station  Nick  Uchitch and Lakki.The Station Restaurant & BarAddress: 1/41  Wasala Ln  Colombo  Sri LankaPeople featured in this video:David (The Hungry Tourist): https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Abram: https://www.instagram.com/ramen_beast/Sinan: https://www.instagram.com/tatdedektifi/Ben: https://www.instagram.com/bigbenyong/Hani: https://www.instagram.com/bedouinfoodie/Ruzaina: https://www.instagram.com/theminority...Thuna Paha Restaurant - For dinner we went to a Sri Lankan restaurant that serves a variety of Sri Lankan food. Again  their crab curry was delicious  but totally different  and they also served pork black curry which was outstanding.Thank you for watching this video about Sri Lankan food on the best or Sri Lankan food tour with The Hungry Tourist (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....).

SLLqlgHqW2I,Sri Lankan Food - SPICY OMELET CURRY + Exotic Fruit in Weligama  Sri Lanka!,Sri Lankan crab curry: https://youtu.be/4v9G2ArswUsBest of Sri Lanka food tour with The Hungry Tourist: https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lColombo to Weligama  Sri Lanka - On Day 2 of the Best of Sri Lanka Food Tour with The Hungry Tourist (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....) we had lunch first in Colombo  before driving to the Southern coast of Sri Lanka  near Weligama. Along the way  we stopped to taste a bunch of local Sri Lankan fruit  including plenty of delicious durian.Mayura Hotel - Northern Sri Lankan food - I had no idea what to expect this day  I didn’t even really know the plan other than driving to Weligama. But we first headed into the busy Pettah area of Colombo for some serious Sri Lankan food from Northern Sri Lanka. Along with serving banana leaf rice and curry with a variety of different curries and seafoods  they also specialized in spicy omelets. The food was incredibly delicious  all the different curries  wrapped up with rice  and smothered in spicy omelet.Weligama  Sri Lanka - The drive from Colombo to Weligama was about 2 hours  and once we arrived to the Southern coast of Sri Lanka  we noticed a truck full of durian. Durian is the King of Fruits  and anytime you see it  you have to stop. We stopped and ate a few durians  which were excellent and bought some to go as well. Just a few hundred meters up the road  we stopped again for another fruit stop to taste of of Sri Lanka’s bounty of fruit. Delicious.Zephyr Restaurant & Bar - Again for dinner  all I knew is that we were going to go to the beach and eat a meal on the beach. Zephyr Restaurant & Bar is actually quite a touristy restaurant  but Ruzaina had arranged a special local meal  including all southern Sri Lankan food. The meal was unbelievably good  dish after dish kept coming  including huge prawns and Sri Lankan crab. It was a meal to remember.People in the video:David (The Hungry Tourist): https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry....Ruzaina: https://www.instagram.com/theminority...Uchith: https://www.instagram.com/uchith/Nick: https://www.instagram.com/nimz_gd/Abram: https://www.instagram.com/ramen_beast/Sinan: https://www.instagram.com/tatdedektifi/Ben: https://www.instagram.com/bigbenyong/Bobby: https://www.instagram.com/bobbyting/Hani: https://www.instagram.com/bedouinfoodie/Thank you for watching this Sri Lankan food video!

Of all the cities I visited in Pakistan  Peshawar was one of the most special  a city of immense history  culture  and some of the most incredible meat dishes of anywhere in the world. People have huge hearts  and a great taste of delicious food. Thank you Waqas and Peshawar for an amazing street food tour!Halwa puri - We started off this Peshawar street food tour with first breakfast  halwa puri  something that is loved throughout Pakistan. Their version was one of the best  fried in pure desi ghee  and what I loved most was the chana  chickpeas stew.Nika Seri Pai - Breakfast number two was one of the best dishes I ate in all of Pakistan - Peshawari seri paye  this version made with stewed cows feet. The stew was so rich and incredibly thick - like one of the most rich things you could possibly eat. What I loved so much about Peshawari paye is that it had an incredible garlic flavor. The meat was fall apart tender melting as well.Price - 500 PKR ($3.73) per bowlSir Cunningham Clock Tower - After breakfast we headed to walk around and explore Peshawar  which has some ancient history  and is a fascinating city to explore. Masjid Mahabat Khan is one of the oldest and landmark mosques in Peshawar that’s well worth a visit.Brains masala - 90 PKR ($0.67) - After having some amazing Peshawari tea  we then continued on to eat brains masala  which he literally whipped up in minutes  and we had a fresh plate of cow brains masala. It was delicious especially with the added chutney.Pomegranate juice 200 PKR ($1.49) per cup - This is a cup of juice I could hardly even believe. It was the best  freshest  and perfectly sweet and tart cup of pomegranate juice I’ve ever had.Peshawari pulao - 185 PKR ($1.38) per plate - Next on this Pakistani street food tour of Peshawar  we had Peshawari pulao  which is quite similar to Kabuli pulao. The rice was lightly seasoned  cooked with meat and chickpeas. It was awesome.Saag and lassi - 50 PKR ($0.37) - Another highlight from this amazing street food tour of Peshawar was the saag and lassi sold by an extremely friendly man right outside the pulao restaurant. The saag was so healthy and fresh  and the lassi was freshly whipped up.Kaptaan Chappal - One of the best things I brought back with me from Pakistan are Kaptaan Chappals  the locals sandals made in Pakistan. We went to the same shop that Mr. Imran Khan  Prime Minister of Pakistan  is famous for buying his sandals that he wears almost everyday.Nisar Khan Charsi Tikka Shish Mahel - Finally  a food trip to Peshawar wouldn’t be complete without eating at Nisar Khan Charsi Tikka  the most famous restaurant in Peshawar for meat  specifically lamb. Everything was incredibly good  and I especially loved the lamb chops.Total price - 2 600 PKR ($19.38)An amazing day in Peshawar  it was one of those days where everything is fascinating  everywhere you look and everything you taste.Thank you again to Waqas for taking us around: https://goo.gl/ipRiqeAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!,food

We ate off the car  enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi  one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple  the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had  called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley  right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt.

3uOKebaeSi0,Allahabad Food Tour - Makhan ke ANDE - SAKODA (Spicy Pakoda) - Gulab Jamun (Allahabadi RASGULLA) 2/2,The sheer amount of food to try in Allahabad is insane. Trust us  if you start exploring the streets for food you will not be disappointed. First Stop- Indian Coffee HouseWe started our day with the basics- coffee and keema omelette. Wait! Ok not so basic. The keema omelette serves as the perfect start to your day. It is not too spicy and not heavy either  but it will keep you stomach happy and satisfied.Second Stop- Sheebu Omelette ShopIf you’re looking for that perfect breakfast and chai combination  this is the place to be. This 35 year old shop is known for serving some of the most buttery Bun- Omelette in the area. The omelette is very simple  it consists of onions  green chillies and coriander and cooked in a whole lot of butter. You can either go for the bun-omelette or a simple bun-butter  and boy do they use butter liberally! Enjoy all of this with a side of steaming hot chai.Third Stop- VIP RasgullaFor all those people who are going to get confused when they see Gulab Jamuns instead of Rasgullas  hold your horses people! In Allahabad  the humble gulab jamuns are known as rasgulla. VIP Rasgulla is known for some of the tastiest gulab jamun. These gulab jamuns have dried fruits and cardamom in the filling as well. Truly delicious!Fourth Stop- Dehati Rasgulla ShopAnother famous rasgulla/gulab jamun shop. These gulab jamuns are slightly darker in colour since the khoya is cooked for a longer time is caramelized. These gulab jamuns are fried twice to get the deep dark colour that gives it a unique taste.Fifth Stop- Sophiya Lawrence Betel ShopThe paan here is unlike any we have had. The stickiness that the normal meetha paan has because of the gulkand cannot be tasted in this paan. It is as smooth as butter. Sixth Stop- Pandit Ji ki ChaatWhen it comes to chaat we really let loose. We tried a number of different dishes here. The gol gappas served here are not your run of the mill ones. They serve you gol gappa/pulki with a variety of fillings- with chickpeas and tamarind chutney  super hot and spicy sakoda curry or with dahi and tamarind chutney. They also give the Allahabadi classic Sakoda in a kulhad. Sakoda is a fritter made with pulses and spinach and served in a curry that is super hot. The Hara Aloo or basically aloo chaat is quite unique  with flavors of coriander and green chillies. Then to cool oneself down  go for the dahi badas.Seventh Stop- Nirala Mishtan BhandarHere we tried the aloo ki tikiya that is nicely fried in desi ghee. It is topped with tamarind chutney  yoghurt  aloo lachha. This dish is super crispy and super tasty. Here also get the Kaali Gajar ke Halwa and some of the best laddus we have tried in a long time.Eighth Stop- Hari Ram & SonsThis shop has been since 1890 serving dried samosas to worldwide and a lot more. The samosa is stuffed with potatoes and fried in desi ghee. These samosas are supposed to have a shelf life of a month.Ninth Stop- Raja Ram LassiRight across Hari Ram & Sons is this lassi shop. Their lassi comes in the good old kulhad. It is thick and creamy and is flavoured with some saffron  and topped off with a layer of cream and rabri.Tenth Stop- Shri Radhey Ras Kunj Sweet HouseAnother unique discovery was Makhan ke Andey at this place. The butter is shaped like an egg and has a filling of khoya mixed with saffron which ends up looking like a yolk.Eleventh Stop- Ahmad Kabab CentreThis place is a Kabab lover’s delight! We tried the roasted chicken  haryali chicken  roasted chicken wings  and nizami chicken tikka. Everything is beautifully marinated here that the spices have literally seeped into every part of the chicken pieces.Twelfth Stop- Bukhara Mughlai KhanaOur final stop was all about home cooked food. This place is known for meals that are cooked at home and sold to people to spread the joy. Here we had some shammi kababs  boti kabab and mutton in khara masala along with some ulte tawe ka paratha and roomali roti. Each and every dish was not too spicy  or oily and it tastes just like home.#AllahabadFoodTour #WalkwithDelhiFoodWalksAbout the host - Anubhav Sapra :Anubhav Sapra is an avid foodie!

I was happy to be in Karachi to discover the amazing street food  and it didn’t let us down!Here are the things we ate on this ultimate Pakistani street food tour of Karachi  Pakistan:Javed Nihari - I’ve probably said this a few times  but there’s no meatier breakfast (maybe in the world) than nihari  a meat stew that’s often paired with plenty of desi ghee and either brains of bone-marrow. It’s truly a breakfast of meat loving champions  but it is filling and heavy  and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.Total price - 1 150 PKR ($8.42)Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road  one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening  so Burns road wasn’t actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha  or mataba  or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups. The pistachio and saffron were the best.Price - 50 PKR ($0.37) eachRabri - I’m not huge on sweets  but on Burns Road we need to try rabri.Price - 200 PKR ($0.88)Chicken biryani - Just randomly walking around we decided to try our first plate of Karachi biryani - and Karachi is known for their biryani. It was simple  but very good  with a wonderful flavor of dried lime  and it was just a very cool spot.Price - 80 PRK ($0.59)Liaquatabad - We continued this Pakistani street food tour of Karachi in Liaquatabad a busy market area  full of street food.Qadri Nalli Biryani - This was the highlight of the food tour  if not one of the best dishes of my entire trip to Pakistan. Nalli biryani  Pakistani bone marrow biryani is one of the best things ever.Price - They wouldn’t charge usSalad - His ninja chopping skills brought me in and there was no way I couldn’t stop to eat his salad. Amazing!Price - 40 PKR ($0.28)MashAllah Fish Katakat - The next meal we had was MashAllah Fish Katakat  and a dish called katakat. Most of the time its prepared with organs  but this was with fish  and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish  spices  and chutney.Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia  maybe the world. Over 700 000 - 800 000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi  Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant  a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis. The prawns karahi was the highlight for me.Total price - 4 840 PKR ($35.45)It was an amazing day of street food in Karachi  Pakistan!Watch the entire Pakistani video series: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMAli: https://goo.gl/VY6NjHJoel: https://goo.gl/5AkWm6MUSIC: https://us.audionetwork.com/Logo: https://goo.gl/VhaLp5CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!,food

IugcIAAZJ2M,The Iconic Dollar Pizza Slice of NYC - Street Food Icons,Eli and Oren Halali  the two brothers who founded 2 Bros Pizza  sell slices for a buck. They're known for getting their patrons in and out of the store within ten seconds  and for selling hundreds of pies a day. And they're certainly not the only people in the dollar-slice game in New York City. Ever since the Great Recession in 2008  dollar-slice spots started popping up all over Manhattan because people were in desperate need of a quick and cheap food option. Now there are more than 80 dollar-slice spots on the streets of New York. People gravitate to dollar slice because it's quick  easy  cheap  filling—and the slices themselves are pretty damn good considering the price. But  according to pizza historian Scott Wiener  dollar slices may be on the way out...so get them while you can!Subscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIESAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/...Check out http://munchies.tv for more!Follow Munchies here:Facebook: http://facebook.com/munchiesTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchiesTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.comInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchiesPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/munchiesFoursquare: https://foursquare.com/munchiesMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo,food

Finally  this was our chance  and we went on a Malaysian food tour of Kelantan  around Kota Bharu.Here’s all the amazing food we ate in this video:Nasi Kerabu Panji - Without a doubt  one of the Malaysian foods you don’t want to miss when you visit Kelantan is nasi kerabu  rice salad  but it’s so much more than that. It’s a breakfast dish and we first started at Nasi Kerabu Panji  a local favorite spot. You get blue rice  topped with salad and side dishes  drizzled in budu fermented fish sauce  and topped with you choice of main mean. It was extraordinary.Price - About 8 MYR ($1.96) per plateJijah's Nasi Kerabu - Since nasi kerabu is one of the top Malaysian foods of the state of Kelantan  we decided to have two nasi kerabu’s back to back  but totally different styles and even different colors of rice. Jijah's Nasi Kerabu specializes in grilled goat  and it was incredible  highly recommended when you visit Kelantan  Malaysia.Price - 4.50 MYR ($1.10) per plateSiti Khadijah Market - One of the top attractions in Kota Bharu is Siti Khadijah Market  a beautiful colorful market where you can buy all the ingredients from Kelantan and there’s also an amazing cooked food section. Laksam - 3.50 MYR ($0.86) per bowl - I had a bowl of laksam  a Kelantan Malaysian food version of laksa. Akok - 1 MYR ($0.24) for 2 - Later we also tried akok  a popular and local Kelantanese dessert.D'Umi Nasi Ulam - Another Malaysian food you don’t want to miss eating in Kelantan is nasi ulam  rice with raw vegetables  and a mix of dishes  all eaten specifically with budu - fermented anchovy sauce. This restaurant was amazing  a huge mix of dishes  friendly owner  and delicious food. Of course  we couldn’t resist the tempoyak - fermented durian paste.Kak Jah Ayam Percik Bulatan Lemal - Finally to end this Malaysian street food tour of Kelantan  we had some ayam percik  a coconut milk barbecue sauce dish that originates in Kelantan. We barely arrived in time  but luckily got the last few skewers.Ayam percik - 16 MYR ($3.93) per big skewerKelantan is an amazing state in Malaysia to eat Malaysian street food and I thoroughly enjoyed my visit  the incredible food  and friendly people.Thank you for watching this Malaysian food video in Kelantan.

This story evolves around happenings in "Gokuldham Co-operative Society" and covers topical issues which are socially relevant.The show predominantly - Promoolves around 'Jethalaal' (Dilip Joshi) who is an uneducated Gujarati businessman. Your 'Taarak Mehta' (Sailesh Lodha)  is his neighbour. 'Jethalaal' finds a friend and philosopher in 'Taarak Mehta' and often goes to him for advice whenever he is in trouble. Jethalaal's family includes his simpleton wife 'Daya Ben' (Disha Wakani) and a mischievous son 'Tapu' (Bhavya Gandhi). Tapu is a menace and a constant source of trouble to all the members of Gokuldham. They have often warned 'Jethalaal' to reform 'Tapu' or else be prepared to leave the premises. Lost hopes of being heard by his son pushes Jethalaal' to call his father 'Champaklal' (Amit Bhatt) from the village. This was his great idea of leashing some control over the mischievous Tapu.

Eyzh-YOqNBU,Top 18 Fat Burning Foods For Women,The top 18 foods that women should eat to lose weight fast and burn fat fast. It isn’t easy to lose weight fast. People always say that a lifestyle change needs to be made in order to lose the weight and keep it off. We are also told that to lose weight we need to eat healthier and work out regularly. Well  it’s true  and in this video  we’ll count down the top foods women should eat when they are trying to lose weight!#WeightLoss #BurnFat #LoseWeightMusic:https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...Summary:18. Citrus Fruits: According to a study done in 2016 by the American Chemical Society  citrus fruits can prevent obesity-related heart disease  diabetes  and liver disease. One way to get more citrus in your diet is by adding them to your water.17. Walnuts: We have known for a while that eating nuts is good for you  but now we know which ones are the best to eat. A study in the journal Diabetes  Obesity and Metabolism found that walnuts  in particular  contain an ingredient that can satisfy your appetite  making you feel fuller for longer. This will cause you eat less!16. Popcorn: The University of Scranton performed a study that found that popcorn contains large amounts of polyphenols. Polyphenols are linked to many health benefits such as improved digestion and better blood circulation. If you don’t add any salt  butter or oil  and if you air pop your popcorn  this can be a great healthy snack to help you lose weight.15. Berries: Scientists at Harvard University found in 2016 that increasing the daily intake of berries  such as blueberries and strawberries  can help people lose weight for the long term. It is said that the reason for this is because berries have high amounts of flavonoids which have been linked to weight loss.14. Whole Grains: A Tufts University study proved that people who eat three or more daily servings of whole grains such as oatmeal had 10 percent less belly fat than people who ate the same amount of white carbs. This is said to be because whole grains are higher in fiber  which keeps you full for longer.13. Avocados: A study published in the journal Internal Medicine Review found that avocados can help people lose weight for many reasons. The reason for this weight loss is because avocados are rich in many nutrients that help with higher intakes of fiber  healthy fats  vitamins E and C  folate  magnesium  copper and potassium. 12. Cayenne Pepper: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition performed a study that found that daily consumption of one of the compounds found in pepper speeds up abdominal fat loss. It does this by boosting the body’s ability to convert food into energy. Next time you’re cooking  add some cayenne pepper to spice up some meat or vegetarian dishes.11. Salmon: A 2015 study from Kyoto University found that salmon helps your body transform fatty white fat cells into fat-burning beige cells. Salmon helps build muscle when following a steady workout routine. It also contains the right types of fats  such as Omega-3s  which helps your body burn more fat.10. Cinnamon: Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that cinnamaldehyde  which is an essential oil in cinnamon  activates thermogenesis. Thermogenesis is a metabolic bodily process that helps burn calories and produce heat. So if you add some cinnamon to your oatmeal in the morning  you’re literally going to be burning fat cells.9. Apples and Pears: Research which was posted on the US National Library of Medicine in 2003 stated the results of a study by the State University of Rio de Janeiro on a correlation between apples  pears  and weight loss. Women were instructed to eat apples  pears  or oatmeal cookies three times a day. After 12 weeks the group that had a fruit supplement lost more weight and had a greater decrease in blood glucose than the group that ate the oatmeal cookies.8. Chicken: A 2013 study in the medical journal Obesity found that boosting dietary protein decreases total body fat and abdominal fat and helps increase lean body mass and your body’s energy expenditure during periods of weight maintenance and weight loss.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to Bestie : https://goo.gl/tUqro6----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------,food

IQw5UOVvDj4,Malaysian Food in Melaka - SPECIAL SATAY + Asam Pedas and Chicken Rice Balls | Malacca  Malaysia!,Watch more Malaysian food videos: https://youtu.be/u5LYl4DM5c4Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lMELAKA  MALAYSIA - Malaysian Food Tour!Melaka (also sometimes spelled Malacca) is a beautiful city in southern Malaysia  significant in history  packed with delicious food  and again  like most of Malaysia  a melting pot of cultures  peoples and foods.Here’s what we ate in this food tour of Melaka  Malaysia:Kedai Kopi Chung Wah - One of the foods you have to eat in Melaka is Hainanese chicken rice balls. The rice is cooked with chicken broth like most chicken rice  but instead of just a plate of rice  you get little fish ball shaped rice balls  along with chicken. It’s an iconic dish  but it’s pretty delicious and makes a wonderful breakfast.Total price - 29 MYR ($7.12)Asam Pedas Pak Man - Asam pedas is sour spicy  and you’ll find variations of it across much of Southeast Asia  but Melaka is quite famous for it within Malaysia. We went to Asam Pedas Pak Man  a stall set up within a local Malaysian food court. I ordered a variety of different plates  each asam pedas but with a different fish. All were spectacular. It looks extremely spicy  but it’s not actually all that spicy  however it is extremely tasty and full of herbs and chilies and flavor. Best Malaysian food dish of the day in Melaka for me.Total price - 75 MYR ($18.39)Klebang Original Coconut Shake - This was pretty ordinary for me  nothing spectacular  but again it’s one of those things most people try in Melaka.Total price - 9.90 MYR ($2.43)Ban Lee Siang Satay Celup - Next up  satay celup  a unique Melaka style satay where you choose your own skewers and boil them in the sauce right in the middle of your table. For me honestly  satay celup is too sweet  but I have to admit it’s a lot of fun to eat and cook  and very social.Total price - 34 MYR ($8.34)Ikan Bakar Haji Masu - Finally to end this Malaysian food tour in Melaka (Malacca)  we went to a seafood  ikan bakar (grilled fish) restaurant. There are quite a few huge seafood restaurants in Melaka  but I wanted one that was kind of small and laid back. Ikan Bakar Haji Masu was fantastic  and I think the best thing was their grilled fish.Total price - 99 MYR ($24.27)Thank you for watching this Malaysian food tour in Melaka. It’s an amazing city to visit when you are in Malaysia.MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!,food

4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTYWe love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite  add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream  sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover  we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it  add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil  put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold  take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party.

Since it is such a delicious ingredient for cooking and filled with protein we created some simple and delicious recipes with cheese that can try right away. In addition  we included some bonus cooking hacks and tips to make your time in the kitchen more enjoyable.1. Simplest macaroni and cheese recipe.If you are at work or would like to have macaroni and cheese as a snack instead of making a huge pot of food. Try this little trick that will literally take you 3 minutes to make this meal. In a mug  add a scoop of pasta  then  add the adequate amount of water and microwave for 2 minutes. Stir it really well and make sure there is no more water left in the mug. Then add some milk and cheese and stir until the cheese into the mug and Bon Appetite.2. Delicious cheese toastie recipeIf you would like to have a nice cheese toast fast but you don't own a grill  don't let that stop you. Apply some butter on a slice of bread on both sides  then  add two slices of cheddar cheese and then another slice of bread with butter spread on it. Then  place your sandwich in a kitchen foil and seal it. After that  take your clothing iron and place it on top of the toastie for a couple of minutes max  then turn it and press the other side as well with your clothing iron and  there you have it.3. DIY cheddar sticksThis might as well be the most delicious treat in the whole world. Take a block of cheddar cheese and cut it in rectangular blocks. Place one wooden stick in each block. Then  dip it into flour  after that dip it into an egg wash  and finally in breadcrumbs. Lastly  boil some oil and fry your cheesy sticks. Enjoy with some ketchup or the sauce of your choice.4. Oil Hack!Instead of accidentally pouring excess oil on your food or your frying pan. Pour some oil in a clean spray bottle and start spraying. This way you'll be able to monitor how much oil you consume and also keep your meals healthier.5.How to make your own iced coffeeMake your filter coffee  or your espresso  or your instant coffee with hot water as you would normally do with or without sugar. (Do Not add milk). Then pour it into your ice tray and place it in the freezer. When it's time for you to have a nice glass of iced coffee  instead of running to the closest coffee shop  just take 5-6 cubes of the iced coffee you prepared  place them in a glass with some milk or water and stir.

_qhIT8sOymk,How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach,How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so  you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It’s definitely something worth knowing if you’re struggling with excess weight.  The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms  it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy  and you get it from the foods you eat.Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That’s why it’s called blood glucose. If you eat something that’s high on the index  your blood glucose will spike  giving you a fast boost of energy.TIMESTAMPS: What glycemic index is 0:58Foods that digest slowly 3:30Foods that digest moderately 4:08Foods that digest quickly 4:34 Foods that don’t have a glycemic index value 5:27What about pizza? 6:09 Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/SUMMARY: - The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms  it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.- If you eat something that’s high on the index  your blood glucose will spike  giving you a fast boost of energy.- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low  medium  and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55  medium is from 56 to 69  and high items are from 70 and above.- According to the experts at Bodytomy  some low-glycemic foods  like cooked vegetables or a salad  can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.- There are also foods that really don’t really have a glycemic index value since they don’t contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats  like chicken  lamb  and pork.- If you’re having pizza that’s just dough  cheese  and sauce  that might rate high on the glycemic index  mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not  adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index  but if they’re processed  they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats  sugar  and empty calories.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,food

DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,We know some products are really dangerous for our health  and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can  in fact  harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”  don't let this fool you. Juice  after being squeezed from different fruits  is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time  the juice has lost all its flavor  which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.In most cases  cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain  check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.Despite common belief  most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. When consumed  trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol  stroke  heart disease  and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar  artificial flavors  and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink  purple  or red  it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine  additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks  digestive issues  allergies  skin rashes  breathing problems  and the depressing list goes on. Even more  popcorn is extremely caloric.Music: Vibe Mountain - Great HopeThe 126ers - Reversed EclipseRondo Brothers - Yellow GoldKevin MacLeod - Jay JaySilent Partner - Pink Lemonadehttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSFruit juices 0:37Energy bars 1:42Cereal 2:31Margarine 3:21Low-fat yogurt 4:11Ice cream 5:01Eggs 6:07Microwave popcorn 7:09Sugar-free candy 8:32Diet soda 9:26SUMMARY-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit  but most of their content is water  sugar  and artificial flavoring.-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar  artificial flavors and sweeteners.-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains  which allows producers to mark their product as healthy  but they also contain unhealthy sugar. -Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid  a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.-Instead of pure milk or cream  manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils  when heated  become nothing more than trans-fats.-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.-If candy doesn’t contain sugar  it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame  sucralose  and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin  which makes your body store fat.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,food

exqcb4DFhzo,Fake Food YOU Eat Every Day!,Check out this fake food we eat every day! From fake cheese to fake steak  this top 10 list of unhealthy processed food is a real scam! Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our "Most MYSTERIOUS Lost Worlds On Earth!" video here: https://youtu.be/oX1rLjFYseAWatch our "Most CREEPY Things Found Frozen In Ice!" video here: https://youtu.be/HaiYn6wpTPQWatch our "Most SCARY Mythical Creatures Ever!" video here: https://youtu.be/LEvBTkPo2R4#10 Prime MeatThe prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That’s because ‘prime cut’ suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.But this isn’t the case in many restaurants. Actually  what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you’re getting a full piece. This is more than a lie  this is disgusting. Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat  it’s made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli  which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See  this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood….#9 Imitation CrabOr maybe not seafood. For one  crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn’t magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There’s still…stuff in it that we eat…secondhand.Nevertheless  it’s expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp  but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It’s usually because it is fake  under the guise of imitation crab meat.Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together  and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish  whatever they can get their hands on  until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab  they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. So  next time you go for some cheap crab  remember that’s probably  beaten  frozen  shaved  and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you’re okay with this…then go ahead. #8 Parmesan CheeseParmesan cheese is delicious! Especially  real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what’s in “parmesan”?The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time  cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won’t clump. Cellulose  not cellulite  that’s just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered “harmless and organic matter”. They usually add 2-4% cellulose  but the FDA doesn’t restrict it. In fact  some has been proven to carry 20%! That’s a lot of cellulose on your pasta! The saddest part is  this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma  Italy. But in the US  you can call it parmesan when it’s just dehydrated  grated mozzarella.This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time  when you get parmesan  it’s not parmesan. It’s cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.#7 Egg SubstituteThis one is a little different. No one knows what it is  but many believe that it’s a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really  it’s still just eggs. They take mostly egg whites  fresh  frozen  or powdered  and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There’s not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don’t want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere  etc. In reality  it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that’s just artificial coloring   salt  onion powder  and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? “Egg substitute” is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn’t just be eggs. Maybe it’s substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is…this isn’t egg substitute  it’s just expensive eggs.,food

P2BVyHOdFUo,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they’re sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton  pop it in the microwave  and chow down  you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is  it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they’re cooked.Other videos you might like:8 EVERYDAY HABITS THAT DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wNAg...7 Food Combinations That Can Ruin Your Health https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRbhv...18 Harmful Foods We Keep Giving to Children https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf5Ak...TIMESTAMPS: Mushrooms 0:55Eggs 1:32Rice 3:01Breast milk or formula 3:57Chicken and processed meat 4:57Potatoes 6:21Celery  spinach  and beets 7:22#badforyourhealth #eatitfresh #eathealthyMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY:- Whether they’re in a soup or stir-fry  reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach  and they also lose their health benefits.- Similarly to mushrooms  eggs are packed with protein that changes once it’s reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact  eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave’s high temperatures.- Even if the rice is cooked  boiling water won’t kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature  its bacteria spores can multiply  and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature  the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.- When it’s time to reheat the breast milk  you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk  which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.- Just like mushrooms  reheating chicken can change the food’s protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef)  chicken contains a high amount of protein  which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them  it’s probably safe to reheat them. However  if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they’re prepared  they’re more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. - While nitrites are dangerous for adults  they’re incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites  they are more likely to develop “blue baby syndrome ” which can be fatal.- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave  don’t forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips  metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuCPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.comEast News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,food

The tag  which would appear on the packaging  also could be used to determine if medications and other perishable products were still active or fresh  they said.

go_QOzc79Uc,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington  W. Va.  TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves  and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh  honest  delicious food. In the past decade  the shaggy-haired "Naked Chef" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows  books  cookware and magazines  all based on a formula of simple  unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous  so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation  for instance  trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.Now  Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner  Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools  cookbooks and television  with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/...TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference  where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

TeLiBBxIbaw,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,Whether it’s rotten cheese consumed by maggots  or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy  here are foods you’re not allowed to eat in the USSubscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv6. Mirabelle PlumDon’t get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won’t get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You’re probably thinking  “what’s the big deal”? They’re just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It’s somewhat of a mystery why exactly they’re banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France  most countries have agreed not to sell them. It’s a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be  you aren’t allowed to eat them  cuz we said so! 5. Unpasteurized MilkMost of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860’s and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case  it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it’s from the mom to the offspring4. Lazy CakesThis cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough  they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn’t found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don’t realize they’re not your average brownie  and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 3. Pig’s Blood CakeWho on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese  good job! Pig’s blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It’s basically like a street food delicacy that’s made with soy broth  sticky rice and oh yeah  pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it  you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it’s still banned here!2. Conch QueenThis beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It’s actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.Purple Mangosteen One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn’t eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it’s found in the US! The problem isn’t that it’s a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out  which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don’t want this thing in our country! It’s been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.,food

5RwIWGkMxrE,Food Fight: How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,When we walk into a supermarket  we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact  over the course of the 20th century  our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh  healthy  sustainably-produced food.Fortunately for America  an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s  where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century  and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.The human body runs on food.  Once  food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war  technological advances in food production led to a new era  that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food  and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed  other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast  convenient food.  This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals  the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.Maya Adam  MD  is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity.

7-bnDnh7Gmw,Baby Food | Corn Purée  Cranberry & Turkey | Farm to Table Family | PBS Parents,Thanksgiving always starts with grand ambitions: turkeys brined to perfection  elegant centerpieces  silky pumpkin pies. But somewhere between the turkey that refuses to brown evenly and the chaos of kids off their normal meal schedule  you throw your hands up in the air and just hope you’ll at least be able to put the bird on the table and take a shower before your guests arrive. In the midst of the inevitable Thanksgiving meltdown  the idea of trying to come up with something special for the baby to eat can be downright overwhelming. But the best part about the Thanksgiving meal is  it’s tailor-made for baby! All it takes is the right combination of dishes you’re already making  and the magic of the blender. Case in point: pureed corn with turkey and cranberry sauce. Tasty  special  easy. Done. ROAST TURKEY  CRANBERRY RELISH  SWEET CORN PURÉE- 1 cooked corn- 1 slice of juicy thanksgiving turkey- no sugar cranberry sauceRECIPE1. Cut corn kernels off the cob2. Purée until smooth. Add water or formula if needed 3. Optional: Add some cooked potatoes to purée with the corn3. Chop the turkey into baby sized pieces4. Layer the corn purée  turkey  and a dollop of cranberry sauce. 5. Optional: Instead of cranberry sauce  baked apples or pears would work nicely as well.

7pcJK1Eciwo,21 Fun Food Designs!,We all know parents tell us from a very early age not to play with our food. But you’re older now and you don’t always have to restrict your life to what you were ordered to as a child. So take that newly found freedom and mess about with your food once in awhile--food can be incredibly versatile visually if you know how to use it  just like whoever made this probably delicious rendition of Han Solo’s best friend out of noodles  rice and leafy greens. Subscribe to Knowledge Feed for awesome mysteries  discoveries  fun topics and all around AWESOME videos !7. Dead Man Burgers  Sure this burger verges on the violent side  but the cartoonish faces the food makes kinda makes up for it. Kinda. What’s better is that making these don’t call for overly complicated ingredients or methods. It’s all the stuff you would regularly put in a burger  just with a little more effort and energy. But really  how hard is it to make mustard and ketchup eyes? What’s even better  other than the fact this particular photo is that of a vegan burger  is that depending if you’re a fan of lots of ketchup on your burgers  you can make it as messy as you want. If you wanted to do the most  you could also carve teeth into the hamburger buns and up the ketchup slathering. The only out of the ordinary thing you would need is a gingerbread cookie cut out.6. Dog Eat Dog  This is the much more scaredy-cat friendly alternative to the man eating burger. Mayumi  who runs the blog “taste of japan”  made these hot dog eating puppies by first shaping the buns and baking them herself  complete with cute black bean noses and eyes.5. Panda Curry  A plate of curry’s never looked more adorable. These rice balls wrapped in seaweed swimming towards a lake of food is too cute to eat--though it looks pretty good to eat  too. It seems that rice balls are really versatile foods and are always incorporated into cute food art ideas.4. Sugarcube Skulls  There’s nothing more ordinary than your everyday cup of joe. So if you want to spice things up in the morning and you’re inclined towards the more gothic and creepy  you can use these cool skull and bones shaped sugar pieces instead of regular cubes  packets or spoonfuls of the stuff. Artist Snow Violent came up with these bones shaped sugar cubes under their Sugar Skulls series. And honestly  edible art is the best kind of art. Or edible anything  really.3. Finger Sandwiches  Literally  these are finger sandwiches. Online  you’ll find the recipe for these snacks up the name of “Creepy  Dead Man’s Fingers Sandwiches. They seem strangely real  but they’re apparently really easy to make. All you need is bread (any kind of your choosing) butter  a spread like cream cheese or peanut butter  almonds for the fingernails and strawberry jam for the bloody mess. Actually  it sounds like it would taste quite fine  even if it looks creepy.,food

fPxDjkqAE2I,15 FOODS THAT'LL NEVER MAKE YOU FAT,What can you eat without getting fat? Everyone’s cherished dream is to eat anything at any time and still not gain weight. Is this possible?! Actually  there are foods you can eat without limitations even if you’re crazy about keeping your figure. Sounds too good to be true! These foods are rich in fiber while being low calorie  satiating you without the risk of gaining weight. Lucky you – today  we’ve compiled a list of such foods! And forget the myth that you’ll gain weight if you eat after 6pm. It’s completely wrong! In fact  if you want to stay slim  it’s best to have dinner 3-4 hours before bed. So if you go to bed at 11 p.m.  you can calmly eat at 7 p.m. It won’t hurt your figure at all!TIMESTAMPS: Popcorn 0:36Celery 0:59Eggplant 1:16Oranges  grapefruits  and tangerines 1:39Melon and watermelon 2:07Algae 2:21Zucchini 2:37Cucumber 2:51Beetroot 3:08Eggs 3:21Pineapple 3:35Apples and plums 3:50Salad 4:03Berries: currant  cranberry  strawberry 4:10Cabbage  broccoli  and cauliflower 4:27#weightloss #excessweight #perfectfitSUMMARY:- If you fry popcorn without butter and sugar (with a little salt  for instance)  you can eat it without fear. This way  a portion (about a cup) only contains 31 kcal.- Celery stems are 95% water. They help you lose excess weight and detoxify your body thanks to their diuretic effect. A medium-sized stalk of celery contains only 6 calories!- A portion of eggplant grilled or baked without oil makes for 24 kcal  so you can enjoy this savory veggie without any limitations.- A large amount of fruit is not recommended if you want to lose weight  yet citrus fruits are an exception here. They’re rich in substances like fiber  flavonoids  and vitamin C.- Melon and watermelon are 95% water. With 60-70 kcal per slice  you can eat them day in and day out. These fruits help excrete excess liquid from your body and satiate you well.- Algae  like laminaria  are the best source of iodine. They help your thyroid function normally  keeping your hormones at normal levels and preventing you from gaining weight.- A portion of zucchini is about 42 kcal. It normalizes your salt-water ratio  improves your intestinal function  and can also be used to lower the energy output of main courses.- A cucumber is 95% water; therefore  this vegetable can quench your thirst easily. And the remaining 5% is a source of vitamins and minerals.- Beetroot is a source of nutrients  such as manganese. They help burn fat  drive your muscles  and regulate your blood sugar. An average portion is just 40 kcal!- You can eat eggs at any time of the day  even at night  without fear of gaining weight. Of course  boiled eggs are better than fried ones. One boiled egg contains about 80 kcal!- The bromelain contained within pineapples actively splits fats and helps metabolize proteins. A slice of pineapple is about 30 kcal.- One apple is only 50 kcal. It makes you feel satiated and regulates your digestion. Plums are rich in vitamin C and potassium  which maintain your heart and vessels.- Salad is a great source of folic acid  and you can eat it by the ton: one leaf of lettuce is 3 kcal!- Currants and cranberries are rich in vitamin C  and the former is also a diuretic  helping get rid of excess water.- A portion of diced cabbage is just 7 kcal. You shouldn’t  of course  only eat cabbage and cauliflower  as their nutrients rival with iodine  but you can easily include these foods a couple of times a week.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZzFor copyright matters please contact us at: welcome@brightside.me----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,food

iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world’s cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny  fluffy  and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they’re made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they’re so light and airy  unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It’s basically a minced-meat  skinless sausage that’s deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‘frinkandel speciaal’ is eaten with mayonnaise  curry ketchup  and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It’s melted cheese  usually Gouda  inside a doughy wrap that’s then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes  the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It’s pretty much deep fried cheese so what’s not to love?Krokets are a Dutch food you’ll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed  it’s also deep fried. It’s long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy  rolled into logs  breaded  and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and  while it’s still warm  breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together  using the syrup as glue. They’re very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food  which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken  potato  hard boiled egg  noodles with peanut sauce  rice  vegetables and bread. For dessert  we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. I included fries in this video even though they’re Belgian  not Dutch. But they’re really popular in The Netherlands and I didn’t think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I’d love to know which food you’d most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or  if you’ve already tried them  which is your favourite?Subtitles available in English and Spanish!

gvHMiduRS-g,10 Foods You Should and Shouldn't Wash Before Cooking,Since childhood  we’ve been taught to always wash everything we’re about to eat to make it safe for our health. However  very few people know that sometimes this habit does more harm than good. Washing certain foods can spread dangerous bacteria that make their way into your body and wreak havoc on your well-being. You don’t need to wash store-bought eggs since they’ve already been washed during commercial processing. Plus  manufacturers often put special substances on eggs to protect them from bacterial contamination.When you wash chicken or meat  the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink. Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb  the weaker their flavor is. You should also never soak  remove the stalk  or peel them.You absolutely have to wash fruits and vegetables with both edible and inedible skin. Don't soak fruits and vegetables in water  either. This won't clean them but only spread the bacteria. Use running water  it's a safer bet. Just dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.Food will definitely get contaminated if you don't wash the can really well before you open it. You should also always wash fresh nuts before eating them  even if they’re peeled.Music: Seven – Twenty https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSNever wash these foods:Eggs 0:29Chicken 1:10Meat 2:08Pasta 3:11Mushrooms 3:55Always wash these foods:Fruits and vegetables with edible skin 4:30Fruits and vegetables with inedible skin 5:12Cans 5:58Nuts 6:34Dried fruit 7:21SUMMARY-Don't wash store-bought eggs. You will remove the protective layer so if the shell gets cracked  chances are the egg will become infected.-When you wash chicken  the water helps the bacteria spread to your hands and the kitchen sink.-Just like chicken  you shouldn't wash raw meat  like beef  pork  veal  or lamb  because it’s also covered in bacteria that the water just spreads all around.-Washing pasta is pretty much criminal in the culinary world because the water removes the starch that helps the noodles absorb sauce more effectively.-Washing mushrooms isn’t a good idea because the more water mushrooms absorb  the weaker their flavor is.-Rinse fruits and vegetables with edible skin under regular cold running water to remove 99% of the dangerous bacteria. Dry the food with a paper towel or a napkin after the “cold shower”.-Even if you aren't planning on eating the rind of a lemon or orange  you still need to wash these fruits and also scrub the outside with a clean brush.-Wash your tin cans with soap before you ever open them to prevent their contents from getting contaminated. -Washing nuts helps get rid of the phytic acid they contain. Plus  you never know for sure where they’ve been stored  how they were transported  and how many people touched them at the grocery store.-Even if you bought dried fruit in a nice pretty package  you have to wash it first or soak it for a few hours.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,food

iloQeu-Yg7U,The Biggest Lies Told in History,From legends about George Washington to historical monuments  here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school  learning about famous artists  we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover  right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don’t mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn’t want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it’s nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt  he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt’s antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it’s still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400’s say that a religious islamist leader  Muhammad Sa’im al Dahr  destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings  have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800’s when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet  like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they’ve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don’t tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it’s highly doubtful that they’ve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted ”Nearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.” This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it’s being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys  American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there’s absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn’t be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn  sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won’t get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans  you can probably take a good guess. Anyways  don’t let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey  which the pilgrims never ate,History

SC29JY-f-x8,Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation Promo | New Limited Non-Fiction Series | History,In December of 2017  The New York Times published a stunning front-page exposé about the Pentagon’s mysterious UFO program  the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Featuring an interview with former military intelligence official and Special Agent In- Charge  Luis Elizondo  who confirmed the existence of the hidden government program  the controversial story was the focus of worldwide attention. Previously run by Elizondo  AATIP was created to research and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) including numerous videos of reported encounters  three of which were released to a shocked public in 2017. Elizondo resigned after expressing to the government that these UAPs could pose a major threat to our national security and not enough was being done to combat them or address our potential vulnerabilities. Now  as a part of HISTORY’s groundbreaking new six-part  one-hour limited series “Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation™ ” Elizondo is speaking out for the first time with Tom DeLonge  co-founder and President of To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science and Chris Mellon  former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense and Intelligence  to expose a series of startling encounters and embark on fascinating new investigations that will urge the public to ask questions and look for answers. From A+E Originals  DeLonge serves as executive producer.Subscribe for more from HISTORY:http://po.st/SubscribeToHistoryCheck out exclusive HISTORY content:History Newsletter: http://po.st/HistoryNewsletterWebsite - http://po.st/HistoryWebFacebook - http://po.st/HistoryFacebookTwitter - http://po.st/HistoryTwitterHISTORY®  now reaching more than 98 million homes  is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative  immersive  and entertaining manner across all platforms.

1-JAx3nUwms,A Brief History of Pi,Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclarkCheck out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental  or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics  rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History A few nitpicky things:- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections  so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares  he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity  but note that this is not what he did.- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time. This is hinted at but not fully explained  so I thought I'd put this here.- Lastly  I am truly sorry for the pronunciations which I doubtlessly completely murdered in this video. At least I spared you my attempt at Chinese.I am hugely indebted to Alex Bellos and his excellent book Alex's Adventures in Numberland for the inspiration to make this video. There is an entire chapter of the book devoted to a broader but shallower discussion of pi and its history  which I highly recommend.You can support the channel by donating at http://www.patreon.com/simonoxfphys---------- II ----------Huge thanks to my supporters on Patreon: Dan Hanvey  David Efird   Elliot Conway  Robert Eldon  Syafiq Kay  Xavier Chesterfield  Jay Wright  Myles Kornfeld  Louis Gillet  Michael Phillips  Neudys Almonte  Fraser Birks  Martin Hermes  Anh Duong  Luca Schumann  Rhys Rickard-Frost  Cameron Matchett  Lachlan Woods  Tim Boxall  Simon Vaes  Gabriele Mozzicato  Jawad Alalasi  Gaia Frazao Nery  Kodzo  Josh Ruby  Claire Anthony  Eve Dillon  Rowan Gow  Matthias Loos  James Bridges  James Craig  Angela  Sanaa Al Derei  Mark Anthony Magro  Liam  Theresa Wang  Kieran Kelly  Wendover Productions  Kendra Johnson  Caitlin Louise.---------- II ----------Vlogs from Oxford students - http://www.youtube.com/oxvlogMy twitter - http://www.twitter.com/simonoxfphysMy facebook - http://www.facebook.com/youtubesimonMy insta - http://www.instagram.com/simonoxfphysMy goodreads - http://www.goodreads.com/simonoxfphysThanks to Vlogbrothers for their sponsorship of this video.

NjEGncridoQ,Columbus  de Gama  and Zheng He! 15th Century Mariners. Crash Course: World History #21,In which John Green teaches you about the beginning of the so-called Age of Discovery. You've probably heard of Christopher Columbus  who "discovered" America in 1492  but what about Vasco da Gama? How about Zheng He? Columbus gets a bad rap from many modern historians  but it turns out he was pretty important as far as the history of the world goes. That said  he wasn't the only pioneer plying the seas in the 1400s. In Portugal  Vasco da Gama was busy integrating Europe into the Indian Ocean Trade by sailing around Africa. Chinese admiral Zheng He was also traveling far and wide in the largest wooden ships ever built. Columbus  whether portrayed as hero or villain  is usually credited as the great sailor of the 15th century  but he definitely wasn't the only contender. What better way to settle this question than with a knock-down  drag-out  no holds barred  old-fashioned battle royal?

Game Capture Artist:JagoFollow Him: https://twitter.com/DjagoUnchained FULL RESEARCH SOURCES HERE:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F... DISCLAIMERS ON FORMATS COVERED:Notice I said POPULAR formats  meaning a format where there is a significant amount of people who compete in it for tournaments and so on and so forth. Now Popular does not mean official even though two of the formats I will be covering were official formats being Japan Nintendo Cup and VGC  but it is an indicator of what a good portion of competitive players thought was “optimal” at the time. Also sometimes the Pokemon Battle Historia doesn't provide enough information to talk about certain Pokemon so I add Smogon analysis to make sense of it. This is pretty rare though.To the people asking why I don't cover Smogon Singles for Gens 1 and 2: It wouldn't really be a history video if I covered those because online Smogon gen 1 meta to my knowledge wasn't actually played until late 2000s. I wanted to cover tournaments/competitive battling that was actually played during the early years of Pokemon (late 90s).To the people asking why I cover Smogon at all for singles: To my knowledge  Smogon was the most popular format for Gens 3-5 and held a number of tournaments throughout the years. As for Gen 6  I am not covering Battle Spot Singles because there is more information and explanations about sets being used relative to their own meta on Smogon. In other words  there are few written analyses about Battle Spot Pokemon besides the Top tiers and I would like to avoid theorycrafting because it may have a hint of bias (though I theorycraft if I REALLY couldn't find information on a certain Pokemon). The keyword here is explanations. Though I did find statistics of most Pokemon used and most moves used  there wasn't really any explanations on why.  Also the few Pokemon I did find analysis of for Top Tier Battle Spot Singles had very similar move sets to the Smogon OU sets anyway. For the record  I do not care what rules or formats people play their battles by nor am I saying these formats are the only formats that should be played. The way you play Pokemon is between you and your opponent and I will not fault you for using evasion or whatever  I just like examining popular tournament formats.Songs Used (List of ALL Songs used for this series.

Ot-acn1whrc,The Coming War On China (John Pilger) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,The Coming War on China  from award winning journalist John Pilger  reveals what the news doesn’t – that the world’s greatest military power  the United States  and the world’s second economic power  China  both nuclear-armed  may well be on the road to war. Nuclear war is not only imaginable  but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world  the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. To counter this  President Obama announced a ‘pivot to Asia’  which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific  their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump  who during his election campaign said “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing”.Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years  the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‘forgotten’ past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance  of which little is known in the West.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries  subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History  the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

QfsfoFqsFk4,American Imperialism: Crash Course US History #28,In which John Green teaches you about Imperialism. In the late 19th century  the great powers of Europe were running around the world obtaining colonial possessions  especially in Africa and Asia. The United States  which as a young country was especially suceptible to peer pressure  followed along and snapped up some colonies of its own. The US saw that Spain's hold on its empire was weak  and like some kind of expansionist predator  it jumped into the Cuban War for Independence and turned it into the Spanish-Cuban-Phillipino-American War  which usually just gets called the Spanish-American War. John will tell you how America turned this war into colonial possessions like Puerto Rico  The Philippines  and almost even got to keep Cuba. The US was busy in the Pacific as well  wresting control of Hawaii from the Hawaiians.

BjkU_JR4Cno,England's Forgotten Queen: Lady Jane Grey's Execution | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,Eight days into her reign as Queen of England  Lady Jane Grey took personal charge of the keys to the Tower of London and even locked her own supporters inside with her. The end was approaching but before her execution  she wrote multiple messages in her prayer book. Historian Helen Castor explores these notes and learns that Lady Jane was actually unflinching and composed until the day she died.In 1553 Tudor England  Wales and Ireland is taken to the brink of a bloody civil war when the dying King Edward VI  son of Henry VIII  leaves the throne  not to his elder sister  Mary  but to his cousin  the Lady Jane Grey.This is a story of intrigue  conspiracy  political manoeuvring and a capital city preparing to be attacked. It is also the story of a young woman  ferociously manipulated by powerful men in the palace  who ends up losing her life as a result.The life of Lady Jane Grey is a tragic narrative. From the moment Edward VI draws Jane into the line of succession  her terrible fate  on the block in the Tower of London  is sealed.Helen Castor is a historian and a medievalist who has studied the She Wolves  those women who held power in various ways throughout the medieval period. Now she sets out to take a close look at the first woman to sit on the English throne  not as consort  but as a reigning Queen. But Helen discovers far more than a story about a Tudor Queen. The story of Jane Grey is surrounded by myth  confusion and propaganda. Images turn out not to be Jane  well known stories turn out to be fake and many of the books disagree on the details. Helen asks why the first woman to be proclaimed Queen of England has attracted so much bending of the truth.Helen undertakes some Tudor detective work and turns back to the primary sources in an attempt to separate the truth from the fiction. She builds the real story of Jane Grey and those dark figures that surrounded her  tracing her world  and the nine days she spent on the throne.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries  subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to ReelTruth.History the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

6pxxS07PZn0,In Search Of History - Charles Ponzi & His Scheme (History Channel Documentary),This episode was converted from an old VHS tape that had considerable wear and tear  resulting in poor audio quality. Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.__________________________Narrated by David AckroydCharles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days  or 100% profit within 90 days  by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. In reality  Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed  costing his "investors" $20 million.While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi  it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.____________,History

alJaltUmrGo,Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35,In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century  but businesses really took off in the 19th century  especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s  European powers carved out spheres of influence in China  India  and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism  England was by far the most dominant  once able to claim that the "sun never set on the British Empire." Also  they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast  wealth-generating empires. As it turns out  improved medicine  steam engines  and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also  the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called "primitive" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

A lot of students may find history boring and would rather focus on the here and now  but sometimes history can be surprising. Bizarre facts and events that we may not have learned about from our high school textbooks. Try as we may  not all information can be stored in a single textbook and history is not an exact science. Sometimes the things that are left out are believed to be ‘too sensitive’ or ‘vulgar’ for young people to hear about and needed to be censored. Other times it’s because it’s not deemed important enough or for convenience sake for different cultures. But these are some of those intriguing events and people that helped shaped the world as we know it today  whether we learned about them in school or not.While many of us would prefer to look to the future  history is a part of everyone’s lives. But sometimes what we were taught in school was only the tip of the historical iceberg.

Los grupos se diseminaron lentamente hacia el sur sobre las tierras de Norteamérica. Hace aproximadamente 22000 años estos nómadas cazadores penetraron en el indómito territorio de lo que hoy conocemos como México. Antes de la llegada de Cortés en 1519  la tierra que se convertiría en México ya había visto algunos de los mas grandes líderes y guerreros en la historia del hombre.

OlwsJWkgu7k,Secret History of the Freemasons ~ Full Documentary,The first president of the United States  George Washington  was a Mason  along with 13 other presidents and numerous Supreme Court Justices. Benjamin Franklin published a book about Freemasonry on his own printing press. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were Freemasons  including the man with the biggest signature: Jon Hancock...Suspected throughout their long history of plotting to overtake the world accused of fomenting revolution and reviled as devil worshippers that stole King Solomon's treasure the Freemasons claim they're merely a civic-minded fraternity bound together by harmless rituals. Our high-energy cocktail of dramatic reenactment expert interviews and on-location footage entertains historians Akram Elias Stephen Bullock and Brent Morris to retell the Freemasons' central myth concerning Hiram Abiff mythical builder of Jerusalem's Temple of Solomon. During construction he was killed by three workers who believed his "secret" would impart magical powers--representing the three evils against which Freemasons believe they're still struggling: ignorance fanaticism and tyranny. Today the world's 2.5 million Freemasons meet to reenact the ritual of Hiram's murder as the initiation ceremony for the main rank of Master Mason.AMERICA: Is America the creation of the Freemasons? For hundreds of years suspicions of a plot to take over America have swirled around the Freemasons the world's oldest secret society. Freemasons led the Revolution framed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution designed our nation's capitaland in the early years of the Republic grew to unmatched heights of influence and power. The untold story of the Freemasons in America reveals secret codes patterns in the sky murder and a radically new picture of the nation's Founding Fathers.,History

Free is nice  but if you can afford to pay a little every month  it really helps us to continue producing this content.In which John Green teaches you about American involvement in World War I  which at the time was called the Great War. They didn't know there was going to be a second one  though they probably should have guessed  'cause this one didn't wrap up very neatly. So  the United States stayed out of World War I at first  because Americans were in an isolationist mood in the early 20th century. That didn't last though  as the affronts piled up and drew the US into the war. Spoiler alert: the Lusitania was sunk two years before we joined the war  so that wasn't the sole cause for our jumping in. It was part of it though  as was the Zimmerman telegram  unrestricted submarine warfare  and our affinity for the Brits.

1o8oIELbNxE,Luther and the Protestant Reformation: Crash Course World History #218,In which John Green teaches you about the Protestant Reformation. Prior to the Protestant Reformation  pretty much everyone in Europe was a Roman Catholic. Not to get all great man  but Martin Luther changed all that. Martin Luther didn't like the corruption he saw in the  church  especially the sale of indulgences  so he left the church and started his own. And it caught on! And it really did kind of change the world. The changes increased literacy and education  and some even say the Protestant Reformation was the beginning of Capitalism in Europe.Get the new Crash Course World History Character poster here: http://store.dftba.com/products/crash...You can directly support Crash Course at https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

Was it the serial authoritarian regimes? The guillotine? The Reign of Terror? All of this and more contributed to the French Revolution not being quite as revolutionary as it could have been. France endured multiple constitutions  the heads of heads of state literally rolled  and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon. But how did all of this change the world  and how did it lead to other  more successful revolutions around the world? Watch this video and find out.

Q78COTwT7nE,World War II: Crash Course World History #38,Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! Visit http://store.dftba.com/products/crash... to buy a set for your home or classroom.In which John Green teaches you about World War II  aka The Great Patriotic War  aka The Big One. So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over  thanks to repeated classroom coverage  the History channel  and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So  why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors  such as invading Russia and attacking the United States  and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So  find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this  plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves. Oh  and a warning: there are a few graphic images in this episode.

okcfKaC87r4,American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths  Education (1995),Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false  Eurocentric  and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks  Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1  2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.In Lies My Teacher Told Me  Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus  the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans  and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their "bland" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes  they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words  the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students  especially groups excluded from the positive histories.The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:The American Adventure (1975)American Adventures (1987)American History (1982)The American Pageant (1991)The American Tradition (1984)The American Way (1979)The Challenge of Freedom (1990)Discovering American History (1974)Land of Promise (1983)Life and Liberty (1984)Triumph of the American Nation (1986)The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)In the second edition  Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:The American Journey (2000)The American Pageant (2006)The Americans (2007)America: Pathways to the Present (2005)A History of the United States (2005)Holt American Nation (2003)Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award [3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship  and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy  in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album  The Sufferer & the Witness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_...,History

Also  if you can afford to pay a little every month  it really helps keep the channel producing great content.In which John Green teaches you about the Progressive Era in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th century in America  there was a sense that things could be improved upon. A sense that reforms should be enacted. A sense that progress should be made. As a result  we got the Progressive Era  which has very little to do with automobile insurance  but a little to do with automobiles. All this overlapped with the Gilded Age  and is a little confusing  but here we have it. Basically  people were trying to solve some of the social problems that came with the benefits of industrial capitalism. To oversimplify  there was a competition between the corporations' desire to keep wages low and workers' desire to have a decent life. Improving food safety  reducing child labor  and unions were all on the agenda in the Progressive Era. While progress was being made  and people were becoming more free  these gains were not equally distributed. Jim Crow laws were put in place in the south  and immigrant rights were restricted as well. So once again on Crash Course  things aren't so simple.Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode.

Jzl9Q3g35ow,PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires,-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines  I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines  for it would be a monument of the richness of the country  to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people  and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstoodplus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines  if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch: https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what  history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story ...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues  even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires  Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education.

dnV_MTFEGIY,The Atlantic Slave Trade: Crash Course World History #24,In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated  how it changed over the centuries  and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization  but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height  or depth  of dehumanizing  brutal  chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world  it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life? In a desperate attempt at comic relief  Boba Fett makes an appearance.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD! http://store.dftba.com/products/crash...Follow us!@thecrashcourse@realjohngreen@raoulmeyer@crashcoursestan@saysdanica@thoughtbubblerLike us! http://www.facebook.com/youtubecrashc...Follow us again! http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.comResources:Inhuman Bondage by David Brion Davis: http://dft.ba/-inhumanbondageUp From Slavery by Booker T Washington: http://dft.ba/-upfromslavery Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse,History

Remember it  Share it and maybe  just maybe  we can be great again!The point of this video? Not to create animosity nor give an audience to hateful statements from people who  because of their own apathy  in part created the world we now live. The point of this video is to make anyone who cares to pull together and stop the down fall as best as they can. To be good to one another and stop blaming everybody else for our own short comings. To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts  but as a whole sum of Humanity!This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!Still people don't seem to be getting the point.I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion  or at least treating them as you would be treated  then how are you helping the situation.And if you're not helping the situation  then what are you doing?Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.1. Evil This is where one feels Anger  Jealousy  Greed  Resentment  Lies  and Inferiority.2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy  Peace  Love  Hope  Humility  Kindness  Empathy and Truth.As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.,History

Free is nice  but if you can afford to pay a little every month  it really helps us to continue producing this content.In which John Green teaches you about the early days of the Civil Rights movement. By way of providing context for this  John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans  but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion  new technologies  and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve  the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result  the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King  Thurgood Marshall  Rosa Parks  and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education  and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster  the Montgomery Bus Boycott  and all kinds of other stuff.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD!

John does this by exploring the totally awesome history book "The Columbian Exchange" by Alfred Cosby  Jr. After Columbus "discovered" the Americas  European conquerors  traders  and settlers brought all manner of changes to the formerly isolated continents. Disease and invasive plant and animal species remade the New World  usually in negative ways. While native people  plants  and animals were being displaced in the Americas  the rest of the world was benefitting from American imports  especially foods like maize  tomatoes  potatoes  pineapple  blueberries  sweet potatoes  and manioc.

The people went to arty school. They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonadeIn my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameI found an ezra pound and made a bet that if i found a cigarette i'd drop it all and marry you.Just then a song comes on: "you can't always get what you want" -- the rolling stones  oh woe is we  the irony!The stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost  the hipsters made a mission to the farm.We drove by tractor there  the yellow straw replaced our hair  we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameYou said "we only live once" so we touched a little tongue  and instantly i wanted to...I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping as the doors were slowly closing on the world.I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours and still the inspector inspected me.The lady in the roof was living proof that nothing really ever is exactly as it seems.In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your nameWe caught the river boat downstream and ended up beside a team of angry footballers.I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will into the welcome doors of the casino.We drank green margaritas  danced with sweet senoritas  and we all went home as winners of a kind.You said "i guarantee we'll have more fun  drink till the moon becomes the sun  and in the taxi home i'll sing you a triffids song!"In my brain I re-arrange the letters on the page to spell your name,History

Although that would be awesome. The presidents most associated with the Progressive Era are Theodore Roosevelt  William Taft  and Woodrow Wilson. During the times these guys held office  trusts were busted  national parks were founded  social programs were enacted  and tariffs were lowered. It wasn't all positive though  as their collective tenure also saw Latin America invaded A LOT  a split in the Republican party that resulted in a Bull Moose  all kinds of other international intervention  and the end of the Progressive Era saw the United States involved in World War. If all this isn't enough to entice  I will point out that two people get shot in this video.

NAU Professor Caitlyn Burford goes more into depth with explaining that it is easy to overlook the impact women have made in history even with all the educational books and classes. Burford says it is important to spotlight these women and bring their stories to the forefront. She does however feel society has come a long way in recognizing the contributions of women and the progress is being made.

8bcsn3aF94c,China’s 21st Century Rise in Historical Perspective,Many commentators claim that China's ongoing global rise refects a restoration of its earlier international prominence  while others highlight that China's emergence reflects distinctive characteristics of the country's current political leadership. In his new book  Making China Modern  Klaus Mühlhahn of the Free University of Berlin provides a panoramic survey of China's rise and resilience through war and rebellion  disease and famine. At this event Professor Mühlhahn will focus on the lessons from history that provide insight into China's evolving international position and how the United States and others should respond. Following his initial presentation  we will hear commentary from two eminent analysts of modern China: Stephen Platt of UMass Amherst  author of Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China's Last Golden Age (2018) and Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom (2012); and Paul Heer  author of Mr. X and the Pacific: George F.

ZTC_RxWN_xo,Secret History of Silicon Valley,[Recorded: November 20  2008]Today  Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants  today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency.In this lecture  renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II  the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department  CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead up to the high-octane  venture capital fueled Silicon Valley we know today.Catalog Number: 102695046Lot Number: X5082.2009,History

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood  known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide  horizontal blade  causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer  wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged  although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) https://www.vam.ac.uk/plywoodSponsored by MADE.COM. Supported by the American Friends of the V&AFind out more about plywood with our fascinating exhibition book  Plywood: A Material Story https://www.vam.ac.uk/shop/plywood-a-...,Manufacturing

Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins  tacks  brads  and spikes. Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer  a pneumatic nail gun  or a small explosive charge or primer. A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally. The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out.,Manufacturing

eF5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood  known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide  horizontal blade  causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer  wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged  although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) https://www.vam.ac.uk/plywoodSponsored by MADE.COM.

We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of thedelivering this manufacturing of the future. Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And  we have to be ready for that.Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their handto improve their business results.Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.From our team rooms we went away from you know hard writtenpaper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings  energy savings  we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations  safety and quality.Too often we provide a solution that is limited.I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain.  The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.,Manufacturing

kwozInrGog0,Traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys in Hrvatsko Zagorje,UNESCO: Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity - 2009URL: http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/...Description: Villagers along the pilgrimage route to the Marian shrine of Our Lady of the Snow in Marija Bistrica in Hrvatsko Zagorje in northern Croatia developed a technique for traditional manufacturing of childrens wooden toys that has now been handed down for generations. The men in a family take soft willow  lime  beech and maple wood from the region and dry  hew  cut and carve it using traditional tools; the women then apply ecologically-friendly paint in improvisational floral or geometric patterns  painting from imagination. The whistles  horses  cars  tiny furniture  spinning dancers  jumping horses and flapping birds produced today are almost identical to those made more than a century ago  though no two toys are precisely the same  thanks to the handcrafted production process. Popular among both locals and tourists  these toys are sold in parish fairs  markets and specialty shops around the world. They have also evolved with the times and  in addition to the traditional shapes such as horses and carts  new ones representing cars  trucks  airplanes and trains have appeared  reflecting the world surrounding modern-day children. Tiny toy instruments  carefully tuned as they are created  still serve as important components in the musical education of rural children.Country(ies): Croatia© 2008 by Ministry of Culture,Manufacturing

The wafers are also put through a special cleaning process.PECVD CoatingThe surface of the cell is passivated  in order to prevent energy loss within the cell. The intrinsic and amorphous silicon layers are separated without cross-contamination  thus achieving passivation with a high longevity.PVD CoatingA sputter process is used to apply a TCO layer to the front and back of the wafer which serves as an antireflection layer.PrintingScreen printing is used to print the contacts on the front and back sides of wafers with silver paste.CuringCuring printed HJT cells is a simple thermal process in order to outgas the solvents within the low temperature paste.Testing & SortingMeyer Burger offers leading measurement procedures for the precise testing of high capacitance HJT cells which require a measurement speed of 400–600 ms.,Manufacturing

dRMF9lC0tXs,Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology LDT:,Additive Manufacturing - Laser Deposition Technology (LDT):------------------------------------------------------------------Laser Deposition Technology (LDT) is a process in which metal powder is injected into the focused beam of a high-power laser under tightly controlled atmospheric conditions. The focused laser beam melts the surface of the target material and generates a small molten pool of base material. Powder delivered into this same spot is absorbed into the melt pool  thus generating a deposit that may range from 0.125 to 1 mm thick and 1 to 4 mm wide. The resulting deposits may then be used to build or repair metal parts for a variety of different applications.There are three main areas where LDT can be used in manufacturing processes; it can be used in repair of worn components  especially in any type of mechanical equipment with moving parts. This process is known as Laser Repair Technology (LRT). Also  this technique can be used in the application of cladding materials  which known as Laser Cladding Technology (LCT). LCT is a process that repairs surfaces on parts by first machining down the worn surface and building it back up by depositing cladding material in thin layers to restore the worn surface. Finally  this technique can be used in performing near-net-shape freeform builds  which known as Laser Freeform Manufacturing Technology (LFMT). This technique starts with a CAD drawing of a part  from this electronic drawing  a tool path file is built. The laser deposition system then builds the part layer by layer. LFMT can build complex shapes  prototyping and manufacturing some parts in far less time than any other technique.Eng. Rami Khalil,Manufacturing

Now  in an HYPEBEAST PROCESS video  we get to watch the entire process in the production of the latest sneaker. Despite living in the modern age where nearly everything that is created is done so by autonomous machinery  it's refreshing to see that there is some level of human intervention to produce the polished product. From the complete knitted uppers to boxing the complete pair  this short exploration  in the construction of the Ultra Boost sheds light on the breakdown of the minimal  lightweight running shoe  and the attention to detail implemented by the workers.For up-to-date news and more: http://HYPEBEAST.comView more HYPEBEAST videos: http://YOUTUBE.com/user/HypebeastTVStay connected with us on your favorite social media platform:http://FACEBOOK.com/hypebeasthttp://TWITTER.com/hypebeasthttp://TUMBLR.com/tagged/hypebeasthttp://PINTEREST.com/hypebeasthttp://INSTAGRAM.com/hypebeast,Manufacturing

subeIZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt  pattern making  sewing  cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process  and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download The following steps can be applied to make any product  so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. Step 1: T-Shirt Design The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy  as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.Step 2: Pattern MakingOnce the designs are completed  you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. Step 3: Sample CuttingOnce the patterns are completed  they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. Step 4: Sewing The T-ShirtAfter the fabric is cut out  it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit  so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size  fit and shape of your apparel line. Step 5: Mass Production CuttingAs soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved  the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. Step 6: Mass Production Sewing Once the pieces are all cut out  they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line DistributionThe last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping  handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

_V9mdAR1ack,Automated Intelligent Manufacturing And Feature Technology With Tebis CAD/CAM,MTDCNC recently invited Paul Scally  Operations Manager from Tebis UK to talk about Tebis automation and the features based technology. Paul informs Joe Reynolds why companies need Tebis automation: “Many companies have engineers who are programming in different ways  there is inconsistent quality in the parts or maybe they are not getting the best use out of their CAD/CAM systems and this is where Tebis can help. What we aim to do is to standardise your processes with automation and improve the quality with all the components at the same time.”Feature based technologyPaul continues to evaluate the Tebis benefits: “Tebis is able to scan a component and auto-detect all for these features from CAD-geometry. In Tebis there are the libraries with the features and attached to these features are variables. The cutting hole can be ranged for example  from 5mm to 8mm. The software can then automate the machine process with variables. So it picks the correct tools for the correct size hole automatically.” TemplatesPaul clearly describes the next topic; Tebis has the technology packages which can help to start with  or Tebis can also send out an engineer who can come and help the user to set-up everything. Tebis will make sure that the software is working in the most efficient manner from the beginning.Moving to the next subject  Joe mentions that he has read in the past about Tebis colour coding and he asks Paul why and how this works. Tebis can apply different surface finish or tolerance to part colours. When you apply these to CAD geometry with the feature based technology with standard automation  or the whole process automation  then the software can actually give the correct surface finish and strategy directly to these objects automatically. Tebis has also built in a filtering system which allows us to link the automation. The system is not just running external plug-ins; it is all built within the software so it will not break if you have new release of the software.Mr Reynolds remains to ask the next question about what the differences are from Tebis to compare to a lot of the competition in the market. Mr Scally states: “The centralised tool library is the one to start with. This sounds easy but in the reality maybe on certain software we have the tool library on one PC and a tool library on a different PC and maybe these are running out of sync. We have these located on shared server drive so everybody gets the latest  version if something is updated  and the same is with the machine tools  where Tebis has Virtual Machine technology with all the limits built in into the machine. This can be used in the programming environment so it is not possible to produce a toolpath which is not achievable in reality. All of these things are built up to make very stable and safe processes to protect your business.” Tebis also can store manufacturing knowledge inside the software  if a company wants to bring new engineer on a board then with the automation  it will be a very fast way to get people to program and achieve the same quality in very short period of time. Paul uses an example: “It is not just the feature based technology which we talked about in automation; it could be the whole machining process. If we take a look on the video where the car is being machined  then the whole process is completely automated with automated tool direction  but this doesn’t have to be a car  it can be anything.”Finally  Paul explains that in most businesses  standards for cutting tools  speeds and feeds  stopovers are most likely written down and are being used by an engineer on a day to day basis. The Tebis template technology allows all of this information to be stored and used efficiently and automatically and has the toolpath still made very quickly to a high quality at the same time.

But we can share enough to give you a rare peek behind the curtain.The Paju complex is made up of eight enormous buildings each seemingly larger than an airport terminal that sit on 420 acres. A ninth  called P9  is currently under construction. When completed  it will be the world’s largest OLED manufacturing plant. More than 17 000 people work at Paju  many living in enormous residential complexes on site. We flew on the LG helicopter an hour south to the Gumi facility  where LG assembles OLED and LED televisions. It was especially big: Picture several warehouses fused together. It doesn’t require the clean-room garb we donned for phone assembly. Because technology changes so rapidly  assembly lines are designed to be modular. The Seocho Research & Development facility. It was born in 2009  and over 3000 people work there  giving birth to high-tech ideas from a glimmering pool of silicon and ambition. And as such  it’s one of the super secretive facilities that LG guards closely: Admission to Seocho meant forfeiting cell phones and laptops  signing non-disclosure forms  and so on. Indeed  we were only allowed to record a short video outside of the building.SUBSCRIBE FOR THE LATEST VIDEOShttp://bit.ly/DTYouTubeSubVISIT DIGITAL TRENDS http://www.digitaltrends.com/CHECK OUT OUR LATEST PODCASThttp://www.digitaltrends.com/podcasts/FOLLOW US!https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrendshttps://twitter.com/digitaltrendshttps://www.instagram.com/digitaltrendshttps://plus.google.com/+digitaltrend...,Manufacturing

2JfVzMvLEn8,Manufacturing in space could save life on Earth | James Orsulak | TEDxMileHigh,You care about the future of our planet. You traded in your gas-guzzling SUV for a Prius and your Keurig for a Coffee Maker -- and if enough of us do that  we’ll save the Earth  right? Well  we are dangerously close to collapsing our own ecosystem and we are running out of time. In this persuasive talk  James Orsulak argues that the only way to really make a difference is to look up. James Orsulak serves as the Director of Business Development at Planetary Resources  an asteroid mining company that has embarked on the world’s first commercial deep space exploration. The company focuses on technologies such as rocket propellant  water for life support functions  and construction materials sourced from asteroids. Previously  James spent a decade developing industrial-scale fueling stations on Earth. He is an avid gardener who lives in Denver with his amazing wife  2-year-old twins and a rambunctious Goldendoodle named Waffles. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx,Manufacturing

-aEuAK8bsQg,Inertia Friction Welding Demonstration - Manufacturing Technology  Inc.,Advantages and Benefits to Rotary Friction Welding:The machine-controlled friction weld process  as shown here  is consistent and reliable  eliminating human error while producing weld quality that is independent of an operator’s skill level. The process parameters are easily controlled  repeatable  and monitored  allowing for real-time and statistical monitoring of the parameters.Rotary Friction Welding also creates a 100-percent bond of the contact area – such as a full-section weld around a diameter on the OD or ID of a tube – creating joints of forged quality. The weld properties are superior to welds created with fusion processes  such as MIG or TIG welding. This results in a higher strength bond and greatly increased design flexibility of part.CONNECT WITH US====================Website: http://www.mtiwelding.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Manufacturin...Twitter: https://twitter.com/MTIweldingLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/manu...,Manufacturing

B8Pkp7OhwPg,Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis  Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages,http://www.driveyoursuccess.com The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput  performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean  the mode and the median.The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately  the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such  it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.Finally  the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case  it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore  we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. Finally  all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

Gigabyte,We toured Gigabyte's Taiwan SMT lines and factory to show how motherboards and video cards are made from start to finish.Ad: Buy the Corsair One i140 on Amazon (http://geni.us/22IWxio)Making a motherboard mostly involves the surface-mount technology process  but DIP (dual in-line packaging) and product packaging are also important  as is the preceding product testing and EMI testing.Note: You'd also like our EMI radiation lab tour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGa1r...Motherboard manufacturing is a refined process  but each board still takes upwards of an hour to finalize on the assembly line. About half of the assembly is now done by automated SMT lines  with the rest being manual quality checks and large component installation (like PCIe slots). As for how to make a video card  it follows exactly the same process -- the difference is just which board is being fed through the machines on each day.This factory is located on Nanping Road in Taiwan  about a 40-minute drive from Taipei 101. Other electronics factories and SMT lines exist predominantly in China  like in Shenzhen  but Gigabyte has shifted operations toward its Taiwan-based factory to help dodge potential incoming tariffs. The company also focuses its higher-end product manufacturing on this line.We have a new GN store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/Like our content?

Z61Uii5K2j8,Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing,Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.PlantRun systems can be used to measure  track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.Improved Time ManagementOperators starting late  taking extra time during breaks  finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late  starting up 5 minutes later  taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine  if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!Maybe you don't think your staff do this  but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a "ten minute" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!Increasing Operator ProductivityAn example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers  stillages  pallet converters  dollies  picking trollies and garment rails.The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time  stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units  an increase of 17.5%.Improved MotivationStaff motivation can be improved in two ways.Firstly  the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.Secondly  the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed  simply from improving operator efficiency.,Manufacturing

Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method  so there is a trade-off.Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes.

WeSOiKYmfOo,Shakar Sazi || Sugar Manufacturing,A sugar cane mill can refer to a factory that processes sugar cane to produce raw or white sugar. It can also mean the piece of equipment that crushes the sticks of sugar cane to extract the juice.There are a number of steps in producing raw sugar from cane:Cane receiving and unloading (receive the cane at the factory and unload it from the transport vehicles)Cane preparation (cutting and shredding cane to prepare it for juice extraction)Juice extraction (two technologies are in common use; milling or diffusion)Juice clarification (remove suspended solids from the juice  typically mud  waxes  fibres)Juice evaporation (to concentrate the juice to a thick syrup of about 65°brix)Syrup clarification (remove suspended solids from the syrup  typically colloid syze of mud  waxes  fibres  etc.)CrystallisationCentrifugation (Separation of the sugar crystals from the mother liquor  done by centrifugal machines)Sugar dryingPackaging and deliveryThese processing steps will produce a brown or raw sugar. Mill white sugar also known as plantation white sugar can be produced by introducing some form of colour removal process (often sulphitation) between the juice clarification and the juice evaporation stages mentioned above.The raw sugar produced is often refined to produce white sugar. This sugar refining can be done either at a completely separate factory or at a back-end refinery which is attached to the raw sugar factory.For Feedback : muslimtvpak@gmail.comFollow us on twitter || https://goo.gl/UjsfLtLike our page on Facebook || https://www.facebook.com/MTAPakistan/,Manufacturing

a_njfgR-Xhg,Experience the Future of Additive Manufacturing In Virtual Reality with Stratasys,The next time you fly  look around the aircraft cabin and guess how many of the parts are 3D printed. Or why wait? Get out your VR goggles and take this virtual tour of an aircraft interior and aircraft manufacturing facility to see all the ways additive manufacturing is impacting aircraft interiors.It features two new examples of game-changing additive manufacturing technology: the Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator from Stratasys.The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator is designed to address the demands of aerospace  automotive and other industries for large  lightweight thermoplastic parts with repeatable mechanical properties. It features a revolutionary approach to FDM extrusion that increases throughput and repeatability. The system turns the traditional 3D printer concept on its side to realize an “infinite-build” approach which prints on a vertical plane for practically unlimited part size in the build direction. The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator combines Stratasys advanced extrusion technologies with Siemens’ Motion Control hardware and PLM software. It’s designed to revolutionize the 3D printing of composite parts for transportation industries like Automotive and Aerospace  plus Oil & Gas and Medical applications. The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator uses a unique 8-axis motion system that enables precise  directional material placement for strength while also reducing dramatically the need for speed-hindering support strategies. This redefines how future lightweight parts will be built  and provides a glimpse into how this technology could be used to accelerate the production of parts made from a wide variety of materials.,Manufacturing

Yet at the same time  firms nationwide say they're having a hard time filling nearly four million job openings. The mismatch is known as the "skills gap": Would-be employers say they can't find workers who have the specific skills they're looking for. Correspondent Rick Karr traveled to Mobile  Alabama to look at one effort to close that gap.,Manufacturing

ZK9cJt3C_I8,What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?,Let’s tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing – planning flows  execution flows and monitoring flows.Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions  shop floor execution systems  and manufacturing operations management (MOM).Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants’ production information  and integrate easily with equipment  controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system  they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility  control and manufacturing optimization – from order placing  production inception  and process control to product output.------Flexware Innovation  Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields  lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it’s still a passion for our FlexDogs today  as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It’s one of the things we love most. Well that  and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena  but that’s a blog for another day.------To learn more about Flexware Innovation and how they help manufacturer's with their MES systems  please visit http://www.flexwareinnovation.com/To download our eBook "5 Risks of Sticking with a Legacy MES"  visit http://flexwareinnovation.com/ebook/,Manufacturing

DhuuOWteelc,Project Tinkertoy (IC Precursor) 1953 US Navy; Automated Manufacturing of Modular Electronics,Support this channel: https://www.patreon.com/jeffquitneyElectronics playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...more at: http://scitech.quickfound.netProject Tinkertoy was an effort begun in 1950 by the US National Bureau of Standards to devise a system for automated manufacturing of electronic devices built up from modular subsystem components. The resulting products were not smaller or lighter than hand-assembled electronics of the time  but were thought to be more reliable and required less skilled labor. The basic unit for circuit construction was a ceramic "wafer" upon which the machine produced circuit components were mounted.Originally a public domain film from the US Navy  slightly cropped to remove uneven edges  with the aspect ratio corrected  and one-pass brightness-contrast-color correction & mild video noise reduction applied.The soundtrack was also processed with volume normalization  noise reduction  clipping reduction  and/or equalization (the resulting sound  though not perfect  is far less noisy than the original).Tinkertoy Modulization of Electronic Circuits by Harold Belmont Price (1953) https://archive.org/details/tinkertoy......The National Bureau of Standards during World War II developed printed circuits to permit rapid production of VT proximity fuzes which were required in large numbers for use in gun projectiles. With the methods used in this development it was found that the percentage yield of acceptable circuits was undesirably low where several lumped components were printed as part of the circuit. To partially offset this shortcoming adhesive tape resistors... were developed. Many different printed circuit techniques have been used since information concerning the VT fuze development was first released in February of 1946......with the exception of the Sargrove venture in producing a relatively simple circuit no attempt has been made to completly machine produce an equipment from bulk or slightly machined materials. The Bureau of Aeronautics became aware of the possibilities of developing such a system and in June 1950 inaugurated the Tinkertoy project as an Industry Preparedness Measure Project...The system developed for use in Tinkertoy makes use of ceramic wafers upon which the machine produced circuit components are mounted. Riser wires are soldered to notches in the wafer edges for holding the wafers in parallel stacks and for providing electrical connections required to the various components. Each module  as the stacks of wafers are called  generally includes the vacuum tube and associated circuitry required by one stage of the circuit. The modules are secured between top and bottom baseplates which are etched with the necessary circuitry for connecting the modules electrically. The Tinkertoy system at present is limited to production of these plate assemblies which in general contain the circuitry of functional subassemblies. A complete equipment will usually contain several plate assemblies plus mechanical parts and any conventional components which are not adaptable to modulization...The circuit components are mounted on the modular wafers which are the key to the Tinkertoy system of construction. The wafer is a square ceramic plate which is about seven-eighths of an inch on a side and about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Three equally spaced notches on each edge are designed to receive the riser wires which are soldered to the wafer in assembly of the module. A fourth notch placed between two of the riser wire notches on one edge is provided for use in indexing the wafers to the correct orientation during the assembling processes...,Manufacturing

There are two types of IS  oil-filled and non-oil-filled. The production of IS usually adopts a high temperature method  which causes the liquid or gas sulfur to spray into cold liquids to obtain IS with a concentration of 30-60wt%. To obtain high concentrations of IS  solvent has been used to extract the soluble sulfur  followed by filling with oil to obtain oil-filled IS [2  7-11].Insoluble sulfur is an important rubber additive agent. It improves product quality  wearability and resistance to both fatigue and ageing. In addition to being universally recognized as the best vulcanizing agent  it is widely used in the manufacture of tire  rubber pipe  shoes  cable and wire insulating materials  latex  all kinds of automobile rubber parts and is also a necessary component of belt tires. Therefore  due to its non-blooming characteristic  insoluble sulfur is widely used in the manufacture of radial rubber and other synthetic rubber products  also in the light-colored rubber products in which common sulfur is incorporated in high proportion.See morehttps://goo.gl/roRfd3 https://goo.gl/wdVJ6thttps://goo.gl/bYgVwX Contact us: Niir Project Consultancy ServicesAn ISO 9001:2015 Company106-E  Kamla Nagar  Opp. Spark Mall New Delhi-110007  India.Email: npcs.ei@gmail.com    info@entrepreneurindia.co Tel: +91-11-23843955  23845654  23845886  8800733955Mobile: +91-9811043595Website: www.entrepreneurindia.co    www.niir.orgTags#Production_of_Insoluble_Sulfur  #Stabilization_of_Insoluble_Sulfur  Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Preparation  Preparation of Insoluble Sulfur  Making of Insoluble Sulphur  Stabilized Insoluble Sulphur  #Manufacture_of_Insoluble_Sulphur  Insoluble Sulphur  Process for Production of Insoluble Sulfur  Process For Producing Insoluble Sulfur  Production Process of Insoluble Sulphur  Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Process  Treatment of Insoluble Sulphur  #Insoluble_Sulfur_(Is)  #Stabilize_Insoluble_Sulphur_Production  Manufacturing of Insoluble Sulfur  Insoluble Sulfur Stabilization  Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Production  Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Manufacturing Business  Stabilization for Manufacture of Insoluble Sulfur  Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Business  #Insoluble_Sulfur_Industry  Insoluble Sulfur Manufacturing Plant  Insoluble Sulphur Manufacturing Process  Set up a Unit for Manufacturing of Insoluble Sulfur  Manufacturing of Insoluble Sulfur (IS)  #Project_Report_on_Stabilised_Insoluble_Sulphur_Manufacturing_Industry  Detailed Project Report on Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Production  Project Report on Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Production  Pre-Investment Feasibility Study on Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Manufacturing Business  Techno-Economic feasibility study on Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Manufacturing Business  #Feasibility_report_on_Stabilised_Insoluble_Sulphur_Manufacturing_Business  #Free_Project_Profile_on_Stabilised_Insoluble_Sulphur_Manufacturing Business  Project profile on Stabilised Insoluble Sulphur Production  #Download_free_project_profile_on_Stabilised_Insoluble_Sulphur_Manufacturing_Business,Manufacturing

L3CkzQQFZXs,Additive Manufacturing - LASERTEC 65 3D,The unique combination of laser deposition welding with a powder nozzle and milling on the LASERTEC 65 3D  is an innovative generative machining method. It allows a faster production of complex geometries and individual 3D-parts. Especially large components up to Ø 500 mm can be produced cost-effectively with this hybrid solution. The flexible changeover between laser and milling operations enables the direct machining of areas that can no longer be reached later on the finished part. The laser process uses a metal powder feed  which allows the additive manufacture of parts without a processing chamber nor the need for a supporting structures. The additive process is up to 10 times faster than the generation in a powder bed. DMG MORI is offering the complete process chain  starting with the NC-programming in the hybrid CAD / CAM system  via the usage of proven technology parameters coming from a material data base  through to machining operations  process monitoring and documentation.,Manufacturing

kusAX4Th4N8,Manufacturing Consent: Thought Control in a Democratic Society - Noam Chomsky,Walter Lippmann (23 September 1889 -- 14 December 1974) was an American public intellectual  writer  reporter  and political commentator famous for being among the first to introduce the concept of Cold War. More Chomsky: https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=U...Lippmann was twice awarded (1958 and 1962) a Pulitzer Prize for his syndicated newspaper column  "Today and Tomorrow".Edward Louis Bernays (November 22  1891 -- March 9  1995)  was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda  referred to in his obituary as "the father of public relations." He combined the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle  Sigmund Freud.He felt this manipulation was necessary in society  which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the 'herd instinct' that Trotter had described. Adam Curtis's award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC  The Century of the Self  pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations  and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine.Harold Dwight Lasswell (February 13  1902 — December 18  1978) was a leading American political scientist and communications theorist. He was a member of the Chicago school of sociology and was a professor at Yale University in law. He was a President of the American Political Science Association (APSA) and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS). According to a biographical memorial written by Gabriel Almond at the time of Lasswell's death and published by the National Academies of Sciences in 1987  Lasswell "ranked among the half dozen creative innovators in the social sciences in the twentieth century." At the time  Almond asserted that "few would question that he was the most original and productive political scientist of his time." Areas of research in which Lasswell worked included the importance of personality  social structure  and culture in the explanation of political phenomena. He was noted to be ahead of his time in employing a variety of methodological approaches that later became standards across a variety of intellectual traditions including interviewing techniques  content analysis  para-experimental techniques  and statistical measurement.The Committee on Public Information  also known as the CPI or the Creel Committee  was an independent agency of the government of the United States created to influence U.S. public opinion regarding American participation in World War I. Over just 28 months  from April 13  1917  to August 21  1919  it used every medium available to create enthusiasm for the war effort and enlist public support against foreign attempts to undercut America's war aims.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committe...,Manufacturing

Alcáçovas is the main manufacturing centre where the cowbells  traditionally used by shepherds to manage livestock  are made. The practice is transmitted from father to son and requires a series of processes before the handmade iron pieces are polished and fine-tuned. Yet the tradition is becoming unsustainable as new grazing methods  cheaper industrial techniques and fewer cowbell makers are leading to its demise.Country(ies): Portugal© David Mira  2014Duration: 00:10:00 - Support: DVD (0106500004),Manufacturing

tTWIIhKI8cA,How to Design and Manufacture a Product,It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one  as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/Step 1: Creating a PrototypeCreating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days  I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product  Planecomfort  was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise  I knew I needed help. Searching online  I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype  but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.Once you have a prototype  there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development  and every time I received the newer version of my product  I washed  dried  pulled  stretched  zipped  unzipped  and put my product through the proverbial "ringer." Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.Ideally  you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term  but due to logistical reasons and production costs  I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something  you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.Step 2: Finding a ManufacturerI located my overseas manufacturers through referrals  which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory  or deal with a factory directly.Once you have determined who you might like to work with  you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:Was the product made to specifications?What percentage of the shipment was defective?If there was a problem with the shipment  did the factory make restitution?Were deadlines met? If not  what did the factory offer to make amends?Is what was promised delivered?How is the quality of goods they produce?How long have you worked with this person and factory?How many orders have you placed?Is your contact easy to work with?Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods  hard goods?What types of companies do they normally work with?Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?Text by Ann Merlini  founder of Pac'n Nap  LLC.For more information on How to Design and Manufacture a Product visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/,Manufacturing

Visit http://www.freshersworld.com?src=Youtube  for detailed Career information Job Opportunities Higher Education details of PRODUCTION ENGINEERING.Just like the name suggests  production engineering is mostly about the study of products and the various processes of its manufacture. Most production engineers are assigned with the task of seeing how products and commodities are exactly fabricated  the machines which are going to be used to create the product and what is the safest and most efficient procedure to get it done. The products could be almost anything  from something as simple and basic as a newspaper to plastic bottles  cans and IPods. Sometimes production engineers are also made to increase the transfer of hydrocarbons from oil into the process of production. Whenever there is some kind of reproduction or creation of a product involved  there is a higher possibility of finding a production engineer close by.So if you are planning to become a production engineer; you must be wondering where your location of work will be. The answer is quite simple; it could be almost anywhere. This depends upon the kind of production you are involved in. If it is oil or gas that you are keen on working with  then you’ll be in some big energy company trying to help the process and boosting cost efficiency. If consumer goods is what interests you the best  then you could be working for one of the biggest supermarkets or malls of the city. All of this does sound fun but there is a lot of effort that needs to be put in before you become a successful production engineer. You have to have proper understanding of scientific applications and must be good at math too. Not just that  you have to be up to date when it comes to new technological developments. Apart from that  you must know how to design  to come up with proper and quality techniques for the system  select the right kind of knowledge and application in order to revamp the functionality of the product and to create and implement different processes and services. In order to start your career in this field  you must finish your 12th standard exam in science subjects such as physics  chemistry and biology. Once that is done with  apply to engineering colleges that have production engineering as an undergraduate course. Here are some of the top colleges in India that have production engineering as a major course• AISSMS College of Engineering• Al Azhar College of Engineering and Technology• Anand Engineering College• Birla Institute of Technology• Chouksey Engineering College• D.

With Sciaky’s exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing  or EBAM™ for short  metal 3D printing is not limited by part size  material  or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length  4 feet wide  4 feet high  and 8 feet in diameter  made from virtually any metal  including inconel and stainless steels  and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  How does the EBAM™ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program  Sciaky’s fully-articulated  moving electron beam gun deposits metal  from wire feedstock  layer by layer  until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour  which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition  a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM™ process to increase deposition efficiency  as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. So  whether you need to produce a functional prototype  or a run of production parts  the possibilities are virtually endless. Our technology partners include the Department of Defense  U.S. Air Force  Boeing  DARPA  Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM™ – Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing – can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.Call Sciaky today  or visit us online at http://www.sciaky.com/additive-manufa...You can also follow us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/sciakyinc) and Twitter  (https://twitter.com/Sciaky_inc) and Google+ (https://plus.google.com/1149476188268...) to stay up-to-date on our groundbreaking metal additive manufacturing process.,Manufacturing

6QNMxwiFcU8,Thanks To Trump  US No Longer Considered A Global Leader On Anything,The new Gallup “Rating World Leaders” poll is out  and the United States under Donald Trump’s rule is no longer considered the global leader. The world now looks at Germany as the epitome of leadership  while the United States has a very weak 31% approval rating. This is a massive drop from the Obama years  as Trump has now taken us back down to the low numbers we saw during the Bush administration. This matters for many different reasons  as Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins explains. Link – https://www.courthousenews.com/report...Become a member today!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWI...Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon  and help keep progressive media alive!: https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFireSpread the word!

Now if you're like me  you're probably ready for the winning distort because man  it has not happened yet. And according to the results of Gallup's recent rating world leaders pole  we continue to lose as a country. You see  when Obama was president in his very last year  the US ranked number one on this world leaders poll that Gallup does every year and we had a 48% approval rating across the planet and that was actually the highest. I know it's less than 50 we are still the highest in Obama's last year. And then during Trump's first year we dropped from 48% to 30% and the results for the 2018 survey aren't a hell of a lot better because now we're at 31% approval rating around the planet and nobody is viewing us as a global leader anymore. In fact  the new global leader is Germany. The country of Germany is now viewed as the global leader. People look to Germany for leadership on the issues. They look at Germany and say  there is a country that's running smoothly. We need to listen to them. That used to be us. Everybody across the planet used to look at the United States and say  Eh  they got some issues  but we trust them. We like them. You know  most countries  obviously not all of them  there's probably a good handful in the Middle East and some over in Asia that really hate us. Rightfully so. But nonetheless  we were the leaders. We were the leaders on climate change. We were the leaders on economics. But now other countries look at us and they laugh and yeah  it's 100% because of Donald Trump. We're no longer even really in the conversations about climate change. We're no longer the leaders in terms of treaties and packs with other countries because Donald Trump is tearing those up like a kid who ruined his coloring picture. We're screwing everything up and I can't even say we here because it's Donald Trump again  screwing everything up. And if you think this doesn't matter  if you think  well good  screw him to hell with them  we're still a leader. USA  number one. Yeah  it matters a lot. It matters on issues like alliances in matters on economic issues. It matters on business issues. It matters on climate issues because if we're no longer the leader  we're subject to the whims of whoever the Alpha dog is at the time. Not only that  it diminishes voice at the negotiating tables. Republicans have to understand that they are backing the wrong horse. Here they are backing a president who is destroying the United States image abroad  and as we saw during the Bush years  that does always come back to bite us  just like it will with Donald Trump.#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews,Manufacturing

Ethiopian Airlines’ CEO Tewolde Gebremariam said he will cooperate with investigation efforts of the US National Transportation Safety Board and Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority. But relatives of the 149 passengers and 8 crew members who died in the crash say they have not been sufficiently updated by the airline about the progress of the inquiry.  The Ethiopian Airlines crash shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa was the second involving a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet in five months. A number of countries including China and Indonesia have ordered airlines to ground the model in their fleets. But in a statement since the March 10 crash  the US Federal Aviation Administration has declared the MAX 8 airworthy.Boeing said it has been working on an upgrade for the 737 MAX 8 since one of the planes  operated by Lion Air crashed in Indonesia in October 2018.

Jobs at General Motors are moving to Mexico.These workers say their communities will be decimated as General Motors shuts down 5 manufacturing plants. GM reported getting$157 million in benefits from Trump’s tax plan. Then it announced plans to close plants & lay off nearly 15 000 workersAnchor: Tonight  major cuts at car giant GM. Anchor: In all  5 plants slated to shut down by the end of next year.Anchor: A facility in Detroit  one in Lordstown.Nanette: The community here in Lordstown  very strong  very resilient. The General Motors has always been like that mainstay. Lot of people out there are second or third generation workers. Their grandpa worked there and they came out there thinking they could have a good life too. Nissan also says it will cut 700 jobs in the U.S.A financial analyst said GM is likely to announce more layoffs in 2019.Nanette: General Motors is flush in money. They made $12 billion this year. We’re selling Chevy Cruze s. We sold 14 000 last year. There’s no crisis going on  it’s not ‘08. The tax bill was a scam. Since they closed 5 plants in the rust belt  they’ve announced they’re going to build the Chevy Canyon in [Ramos Arizpe] Mexico. They’re decimating entire communities. It’s not just the 3 500 workers at General Motors. It’s all the surrounding businesses.

The company has license agreement with a number of larges OEMs and manufacturers  such as Huawei  Apple  LG and Sony  who utilise its R&D capability. As Dirk says  sourcing of technologies is as old as the industry itself  as not everything can be developed in-house. Whilst 5G is the talk of the show  the first technical specification was only released a year ago.

SsEHEx54LOk,Bad News For Trump – His Buddies Say They Will Cooperate With Investigations,When the Democrats sent out their letters requesting documents and other evidence from Trump’s associates earlier this week  it seemed like a fantasy to think any of these people would cooperate without subpoenas and legal fights. But as it turns out  a lot of them are more than willing to hand over everything they have on the President  including his former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and the chairman of his inaugural committee Tom Barrack.

I thought  that's good. We need some accountability. I'm glad they're doing these investigations. I have very low hopes for impeachment  but at least we could get the truth on a lot of this  but I also thought at the time  nobody's going to willingly hand over these documents or cooperate with you. Hey  these are Trump's buddies  his friends  his pals as business associates  his businesses themselves. They would have to be crazy to turn over these documents and willingly cooperate and I had predicted that a lot of lengthy legal battles were going to result in this. Luckily  apparently I was wrong because there have been a handful of people who got these document requests who have now said  hell yeah  I'll cooperate. What do you want? Let me know. I've got it all in storage. I'll be more than happy to hand it over to you. Two of the big ones who are kind of at the center of a lot of it  even if they don't seem like they are  is Tom Barak  who was a good personal friend of Donald Trump. He also chaired the president's inaugural committee  which is subject of a massive investigation right now in case you weren't aware of that. He said  yeah  I'll cooperate what you want. The other person is Sean Spicer  the former press secretary  and as we've been told in the past  Sean Spicer kept notes of everything. A lot of it to Trump's dismay  he didn't like that. He like everything being written down  but Sean Spicer did  and now Sean Spicer says  yeah  you want what I've got have added. I had nothing to lose. Right? I can't even find a job. Nobody wants to hire me because I'm pretty much really discredited  but I'll give you all the documents you want. This is bad news for Donald Trump. And the fact that these people  I  this all happened within 24 hours by the way of these document requests going out  the fact that they were so willing to immediately say  heck yeah  and let me know what you want. I'll make it happen. That is going to really force other folks to kind of do the same thing. Now obviously there's people who were on that a document list that are not going to cooperate. Eric Trump  Donald Trump  Jr. Ivanka  Eric Prince from black water who is actually also a part of the  uh  uh  Mueller.. targets  they're not going to hand over anything. The Trump organization probably not going to hand it over. Those are going to be the ones that get fought out in court and those people in organizations are likely going to lose. But the number of smaller people are lower people down on the totem pole that begin to flip and cooperate. And the people just above them who start to see that start to get a little worried  they then start to cooperate and so on and so forth. And before you know it  you've had a lot of your former friends going to talk to members of Congress handing them documents that you never thought they would get their hands on it. Yeah. This is going to be unpleasant for Donald Trump  but in the interest of transparency is going to be amazing for the American public.#rof #trofire #theringoffire #progressivenews,Manufacturing

jPbqIZ0EvhU,How the universe was created - Beyond the Big Bang - Universe Science and Technology,The universe began with a massive expansion  billions and billions of years ago  and it continues to expand with every passing second. The idea that the universe  and man’s very existence  began with a “Big Bang” is no longer a topic of debate among most scientists–it is essentially taken as fact. How has man come to this conclusion  and how has our knowledge evolved so that we can recreate the very first seconds of our universe and all that has developed since? Interviews with the world’s leading physicists and historians are woven together with animated recreations and first-person accounts to explain concepts such as the formation of galaxies  the creation of elements and the formation of Earth itself....#Documentary #Universe #Space,Science and Technology

MygG9yoPKjQ,Big Bang Theory & Evolution of Our Universe - Space Science and Technology,How was our Universe created? How did it come to be the seemingly infinite place we know of today? And what will become of it  ages from now? These are the questions that have been puzzling philosophers and scholars since the beginning the time  and led to some pretty wild and interesting theories. Today  the consensus among scientists  astronomers and cosmologists is that the Universe as we know it was created in a massive explosion that not only created the majority of matter  but the physical laws that govern our ever-expanding cosmos. This is known as The Big Bang Theory.,Science and Technology

dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech  genetic engineering  and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically  we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first  and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives  we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide  and now  a quarter century later  everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030  even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction  the literature of the human species encountering vast  mind-altering changes  whether they arrive via scientific discoveries  technological innovations  natural events  aliens  or societal shifts  has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic  then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.Follow us on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/list25Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/list25Website: http://list25.comInstagram: https://instagram.com/list25/Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/list25/Check out the physical list here: http://list25.com/25-modern-science-a...Voice control is now a trend The Cancer Gene FingerprintRobot snake automatically wraps around an object when thrownFlying carsFirst planet with FOUR suns discoveredNASA begins using robotic exoskeletonsDiamond planet discoveredArtificial leaves generate electricityVoyager I leaves the Solar SystemSelf-Driving bus is legal in Greece3-D printer creates full-size houses in one sessionDNA was photographed for the first timeGenetically modified silk is stronger than steelDARPA robot can traverse an obstacle courseLaser guns are now a realityEye implants give sight to the blindQuadriplegic successfully uses mind-controlled robotic armYou can swallow a pill-sized camera instead of invasive scopesinFORM 3-D display allows remote manipulation of physical objectsEngineers create a paper-thin robot skin that responds to touchScientists create Matrix-esque artificial wombHuman brain is hackedInvisibility cloak technology took a huge leap forwardSuperman’s view through walls becomes realityThe world’s first fully mind-controlled synthetic leg goes for a stroll,Science and Technology

X_ESxckVR7M,Master of Technology Management: Engineering  Science and Entrepreneurship,For more information: http://www.mtm.ucsb.eduThe best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills  engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures  both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google  Facebook  Oracle  Tesla  JDS Uniphaseas well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allowyou to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars andteachers in the field of technology management who have invested in  founded  lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours  extracurricular events  even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart  ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology   focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents   this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application  visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.,Science and Technology

myet2JziIX4,Ancient Egyptian Science & Technology History World Secrets,Ancient Egyptian Science & Technology History World Secretshe great temples and monuments of ancient Egypt continue to fascinate and amaze people in the modern day. The sheer size and scope of structures like the Great Pyramid at Giza or the Temple of Amun at Karnak or the Colossi of Memnon are literally awe-inspiring and naturally encourage questions regarding how they were built. All across the Egyptian landscape rise immense structures  thousands of years old  which have given rise to many different theories as to their construction. While a number of very significant questions remain unanswered  the simplest explanation for many can be found in ancient Egyptian inscriptions  texts  wall paintings  tomb inscriptions  art  and artifacts: the ancient Egyptians had an extraordinary command of science and technology.,Science and Technology

OfdjeCwaD-s,Julio M. Ottino: How Art  Science  and Technology Separated (and May Join Again),Julio M. Ottino  dean of the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University  speaks to the Northwestern University Women's Board.Abstract:There was a time before science and technology were known by those names. Art  technology  and science formed a continuum  and the modes of thinking enriched each other. The 16th century has many examples of cooperative enterprises between scientists and artists; Galileo Galilei may be clearest case of Italian Renaissance art affecting the course of science. Galileo is also associated with birth of the scientific method  and the scientific method changed everything: science broke company with art  and mixing imagery with analytical thinking became suspect (at least by some). This view is far too narrow -- visual imagination is a central element of scientific imagination. This talk will cover the links between art  technology  and science through time  starting when people had a foot in two camps and when new technologies appeared and the scientific basics of those technologies were still evolving  until reaching examples of the present time. It closes with lessons that can be transferred across domains.,Science and Technology

xLXOrXd5Bl4,History of Food Science & Technology [For Beginners],Do you know that most of the food we see on the shelf of the supermarkets today  wasn’t available a 100-150 years from now? This was because there were very few techniques to preserve the food. The food would spoil very fast and a lot of people suffered from food poisoning and even death. The food we eat today  is completely taken for granted because it is cheap and easily available. The food you and I are eating today has been possible because of the efforts of a lot of scientists  researchers  engineers  food technologists  nutritionists so that the food you are eating is safe and healthy. But the process of developing food wasn’t invented overnight. So  what is the history and how food technology originated?Well if you ask me  I think the preservation of food has been abundant since early human started farming. Early humans realized the fact that they could not always hunt for animals or pluck fruits from trees every day. And if they stored the food like meat  it spoiled very fast. So  they had to develop some preservation techniques for eating the food even when they could not hunt  or the fruits and vegetables weren’t available.Some of the earliest preservation techniques include Sun-Drying  freezing  salting  fermentation and so on. The downside of the early preservation techniques was that they changed the flavour and texture of the food along with huge loss of vitamins most of the time. These techniques were not very effective for travellers and soldiers who needed a healthy diet. During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815)  the French Government offered 12 000 Francs to anyone who could develop a method for preserving food for the military. In 1809  a French confectioner and chef developed a method of sealing the food in glass jars. The name of that French man was ‘Nicholas Appert’. The process was simple. He sealed the food in a glass jar and then heated the jar for some time depending upon the food. The method proved to be successful and he was awarded 12 000 Francs. The invention of canning is considered as the major turning point in the history of food technology and food science. Because of his remarkable contribution  Nicholas Appert is also known as the ‘Father of Canning’. And even canning is sometimes referred to as ‘Appertization’. Although canning was successful but the science behind its success wasn’t known until 50 years later  when a French microbiologist and chemist showed that growth of micro-organisms is responsible for the spoilage of beverages. He also invented a process where milk was heated to a specific temperature for a specified time to kill the spoilage micro-organisms. That French microbiologist was none other than Louis Pasteur. The process he invented is still prevalent in the dairy industry and wine industry as well. And in the honour of Louis Pasteur  the process is known as ‘Pasteurization’. In 1895  almost a 30 years later in Boston  Massachusetts  William Lyman Underwood of a canning company worked with Samuel Prescott to develop the research which would further lead to the concept of ‘Thermal Death Time’. A lot of people don’t consider this event when it comes to the history of food technology  but this was also one of the turning points in the history as their research was important to determine the time-temperature combination for a food. That means  for how long a food will be cooked at what temperature. Since then  a lot of research and discoveries had been done but in the 20th century  food safety was still an issue. In 1960  the Pillsbury company  NASA and the USA army labs collaborated to develop safe and healthy food for the astronauts. Eventually  they developed a systematic preventive approach to ensure food safety and that came to be known as ‘HACCP’. HACCP is a preventive tool used in food industry to ensure safety of the food.HACCP is prevalent today in every food industry and food safety is incomplete without the implementation of the HACCP program. Since the development of HACCP  there have been a lot of rapid growth in the food technology. Industrialists have adopted newer technologies to process the food in a faster and efficient way. So  these were some of the major breakthroughs in the history of food technology.-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: "What Is Food Safety & Why You Need to Know About It?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQLvn...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-,Science and Technology

UT4JaZFGwv0,Science  Technology & Society: Knowledge in Practice - short version,Knowledge and technologies are deeply intertwined with the ways we live in the world. How we communicate  move  work and care for our health – all this is constantly changing through new scientific and technological options. However  new techno-scientific possibilities also challenge existing value structures and ways of living  which leads to societal debates about risks  ethics and social justice.At the same time  science and technology are not untouched by the societal environment they are part of. Socio-economic expectations and broader imaginaries of techno-scientific futures are part and parcel of contemporary research cultures  and influence how knowledge is produced and innovations are made.Understanding these complex relations of science  technology and society is crucial in the world of today. Vienna university's Science-Technology-Society programs offer a unique opportunity to acquire expertise in this domain.In this video  Alumni of the Department of Science and Technology Studies at the University of Vienna speak about how they apply their expertise in professional practice.More information: http://sts.univie.ac.at,Science and Technology
h4yP_Ltc97E,Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology,The project to establish the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was first announced in June 2001 by the Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and the Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy. The Japanese Cabinet Office promotes the project with the following three objectives:Firstly  to establish in Japan a leading center for research and education that will address new challenges in science and technology. Having achieved economic development through technological innovation  Japan is keen to make significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. Today  many emerging fields of science and technology require multidisciplinary research. The Institute will focus on integrative approaches to high level research and education. Secondly  to provide a successful model of a research university for Japanese academia. Existing universities with rigid departmental structures face difficulties in developing new systems to accommodate integrative research and education. An additional challenge is to establish a fully internationalized environment. Aside from the Institute holding lectures in English  the Institute will encourage the use of English as the working language of the graduate university. It is hoped that the infusion of differing cultural mindsets will develop a creative atmosphere that nurtures an original and questing spirit.Thirdly  to stimulate the economic transformation of Okinawa. As Okinawa moves beyond the 30th anniversary of Reversion to Japan (2002)  the need to develop a self-sustaining  private-sector-driven economy is clear. As an integral step in this process  the Institute aims jump start the development of an industrial and technological cluster. Okinawa's beautiful natural surroundings and geographical proximity to several East-Asian metropolis provide an ideal setting for a world-class university.,Science and Technology

FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years  starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of “the beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution”. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s  including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‘clean coal technologies’  links between provincial level research and policy making  and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China’s changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‘catching up’ of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China’s emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration  his talk charts the country’s ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham’s perspectives on this process.

4u3f7_p1i8c,Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field,John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India  20 February  2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern WorldVedic Science is scientific  practical  and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality—the unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation  smaller and smaller time and distance scales  from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels  culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter  culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life—the field of transcendental existence  or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences  one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective  describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy  and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly  at every level of manifest creation  these two descriptions of nature’s functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles  the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover  this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well—the self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly  superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field  which unfold sequentially to 24  64  and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing  but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness  revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending—moving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness  the Self (Atma)—provides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga  at its deepest level  is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)—the union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness  a “wakeful hypo-metabolic state” of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest  which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging  measurable benefits for mental and physical health  as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level  but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda  Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based  unified field-based approaches  with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly  Vedic approaches to education  defense  and civilization as a whole are Atma-based  unified field-based approaches  completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality—the unified field.,Science and Technology

af_qq-hX3QM,College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  Part 1 of 2,Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.HKUST has modern buildings  it has a very modern large campus  compared to the other Asian universities like NTU  HKU. It has a beautiful campus  right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea  they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well  half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year  including 800 students in the Engineering School.One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn’t matter whether you have done IB  ICSE or CBSE  everyone can get a scholarship  only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early  a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.The cost is around HKD 120 000 for international students and HKD 40 000 for local students. The government funds each child  whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong – approx. HKD 15 000 – 20 000 per year which is very low.Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options  you can do three courses in one area to call that your option  he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math  comp science  history  science and technology – any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse – he is the financial secretary of the art club  the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit  as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too  they have a football field  running track near the sea  an indoor football court too  8 tennis courts  squash courts  badminton courts  indoor gym  table tennis tables  indoor and outdoor swimming pools  multi purpose hall for martial arts.  Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded  10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines  Indonesia  Taiwan  Korea  India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.Please Watch Part 2 of 2 coming soonVideo Chat with Ansh NastaHost - Chetna VasishthWe are on -YouTube.com/c/ChetChatFacebook.com/chetchat101Twitter - @chetchat101Instagram - chetchat101Google.com/+/ChetChatchetchat101@gmail.comchetchat101.tumblr.com vimeo.com/chetchataffimity.com/u/chetchat,Science and Technology

Vtgkcz87XbA,1001 Inventions: Pioneers of Science and Technology,Discoveries made from the 7th to 17th centuries by multi-faith scientists in Muslim civilization have had a huge but hidden influence on the modern world.  Knowledge from Assyrian  Babylonian  Chinese  Egyptian  Greek  Indian  Persian and Roman civilizations was highly prized in the Muslim world.  Men and women scholars advanced science by building upon the ancients and making breakthroughs that paved the way for the European Renaissance.This Golden Age of Discovery in the Muslim World (southern Europe  Africa  Middle East  Asia and to China) took place during the so-called Dark Ages of Europe.  Muslim civilization promoted free-thinking  rationalism and tolerance. Many scholars expressed their faith by seeking to serve society and improve quality of life for others.,Science and Technology

He is the founder of the Starburst Foundation and has authored many papers and books including the popular Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion.As a conventionally trained scientist  he was employed by the US Patent Office and was wrongfully terminated. He fought back and had the anti-discriminatory laws changed so that they could no longer fire anyone for their scientific beliefs. He is a champion for free thought and has certainly proved this by his development of Sub Quantum Kinetics – SQK – a model that appears to be able to answer many of the underlying mechanisms of seemingly complex subjects.Dr. LaViolette beings with a discussion on the Sun Cell developed by Black Light Power Corp.  a technology that could one day power and heat our home. It is able to capture energy released in water from the transition of hydrogen atom orbital electrons to subground energy states. While this behavior is not anticipated by standard quantum theory  the novel physics methdology of subquantum kinetics (SQK) does allow this.Release July 2017.

7esFwccEjEY,William Mong Institute of Nano Science and Technology  HKUST,Nanoscience and technology are perceived as key emerging areas of science that will affect mankind in the 21st century. At The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  faculties started research related in this field more than a decade ago. The Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST) was established in 2001 at the HKUST  with Prof. Ping Sheng of the Physics Department appointed as the founding Director to coordinate and promote research in nanoscience in HKUST.HK$10 million was donated to INST by Dr. William Mong Man Wai and the Shun Hing Education and Charity Fund Ltd. In recognition of their donation and the continuous support of research excellence  INST was renamed to the William Mong Institute of Nano Science and Technology (WMINST) on February 1  2008.To fulfill its role as the facilitator of nanoscience research  WMINST has approved seed money for small scale exploratory projects  and has committed a substantial proportion of its available resources to procure community equipments that are housed in central facilities.  WMINST also hosts workshops  conferences and seminars related to nanoscience.  The long term goal of WMINST is to nurture collaborative research programs that can attract a significant amount of external funding  and to create research outputs that can have a lasting impact.http://wminst.ust.hk,Science and Technology
pgX3JtwboEc,Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology,The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive  one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays)  was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima  Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2 768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives  one constructed in 1923  and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co.  Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm  British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the "strong man of the woods" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings  making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left  positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus  all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22 580 pounds (10  242 Kg)  allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks  extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design  the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive.,Science and Technology

lATa1bdU3Ec,President Obama Stresses Importance of Science and Technology to the Nation's Future,On April 29  2013 -  President Barack Obama reiterated his strong support for science and technology in this speech to members of the National Academy of Sciences at its 150th annual meeting. Science  technology  engineering  and medicine are critical to the nation's prosperity  Obama said  noting that investments made today are bound to pay off for many years to come. The president warned that recent mandatory cuts in federal spending could slow these critical advances in research.  "With the pace of technological innovation today  we can't afford to stand still for a year or two years or three years " Obama said. "We've got to seize every opportunity we have to stay ahead  and we can't let other countries win the race for ideas and technology of the future." Just as science and technology have advanced the nation in the past  he noted  they will be critical in addressing today's challenges. "We will continue to pursue advances in science  engineering  infrastructure  education  and environmental protection  and especially science-based innovations to help us minimize and adapt to global threats like climate change " Obama said.President Obama made an impassioned plea to ensure that the nation's young people continue to maintain their spirit of discovery and receive strong educations in STEM.  "We don't want our kids just to be consumers of the amazing things that science generates " Obama said. "We want them to be producers as well.  We've got to make sure we're supporting that next generation of dreamers and risk takers." Since Abraham Lincoln signed the congressional charter founding the National Academy of Sciences 150 years ago  the Academy has played a critical role in advancing science and shaping public policy. "[Lincoln] recognized that finding a way to harness the highest caliber scientific advice for the government would serve a whole range of long-term goals for the nation " Obama said  noting that his administration turns to the Academy for advice on many issues."Like President Lincoln 150 years ago  President Obama clearly understands the importance of S&T to the future prosperity and security of our nation " said NAS President Ralph J. Cicerone in introductory remarks. "We're pleased that President Obama and the administration continue to turn to the National Academy of Sciences for help  analysis  and advice on many issues facing the nation and the world today."President Obama is the only president to address the National Academy of Sciences' annual gatherings of members twice; he also spoke at the 2009 NAS annual meeting. Other presidents who have addressed the NAS include George H.W. Bush in 1990  John F. Kennedy  who spoke at the NAS Centennial Convocation in 1963 and at the NAS annual meeting in 1961  Jimmy Carter in 1979  and Calvin Coolidge in 1924.The National Academy of Sciences is a private  nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership  and -- with the National Academy of Engineering  Institute of Medicine  and National Research Council -- provides science  technology  and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.,Science and Technology
jkV6HJeeklU,UNSW Food Science & Technology | Episode 1: Adventures of Norge,Throughout human history  food science and technology has probably been one of the most important of all innovations.It is multidisciplinary  having its origins based in engineering  chemistry  and biology.It is impossible to know precisely how or when milk was discovered as a food source for adults  but at some point it was. Milk contains bacteria; bad ones can cause food poisoning  and they can double every twenty minutes depending on the temperature  moisture and nutrients.Good Bacteria makes the tastiest dairy foods. Like yogurt is made from lactobacillus.Paleolithic man discovered fire about one million years ago. When applied to cooking  food preservation techniques were born. Cooking food kills bacteria that can make people sick.Even today  food scientists are developing and applying new technologies to modern day food products.Find out more about Food Science & Technology programs offered through the School of Chemical Engineering at UNSW Australia.

zO3HZdejf_U,Science & Technology Policy Fellows: Transforming Global Science,Over the past 40 years  AAAS S&T Policy Fellows have gone on to top leadership posts in U.S. science policy. In a new video  several alumni discuss the program's global impact. In the early 1970s  science-related issues emerged at the center of public debate and at the top of the U.S. political agenda: water and air pollution  energy and nuclear power  the future of the space program. And yet leaders in the U.S. science community  including some at AAAS  realized that Congress and other policy agencies lacked the scientific expertise that would be essential in addressing these issues.To fill the need  they established the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships  and in 1973  seven select scientists and engineers—the first class of Fellows—were dispatched to congressional offices. Over the next four decades  each new year brought a new and bigger class of Fellows. As the years have passed  alumni have risen to high-impact positions in Congress  the White House  the State Department  federal agencies  research universities  and non-governmental organizations.

pRDlSiJVP9o,The Revolution of Science & Technology Since 1945,Science and Tech Since 1945Have you ever watched a cartoon snowball roll down a hill? It usually picks up snow on its way down  getting larger and larger  before inevitably running over someone. In many ways  the advancement of science and technology since World War II (WWII) has acted a lot like that snowball - out of a few small technological developments and breakthroughs has come even more innovation and new devices which seem to come to market at a faster pace every day. It's how we can go from adding machines the size of an apartment to handheld computers in barely a half century. This lesson will detail some of these mind-boggling advances in the world of science and technology since WWII.CommunicationsCommunications and the dissemination of information is so ubiquitous now that we hardly even realize the constant flow of information hitting us. Prior to WWII  the main form of household communications device most people had in their homes was the radio. Televisions existed  but they were generally very expensive and the programming options were very few. The television exploded in popularity in the 1950s  allowing people to watch important events as they happened in real time.For example  many Americans watched Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon in 1969 from the comfort of their own couch. Likewise  the televised 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II allowed many British residents to see the pomp and circumstance surrounding a royal coronation for the first time.As the decades wore on  television technology became better and better as color televisions largely replaced the original black-and-white sets in the 1970s. Accessories such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) proliferated as screens got larger and the definitions became crisper. In the 1990s  high definition (HD) televisions hit the market which produced a markedly more crisp and vibrant picture than before  though it took approximately a decade before HD televisions became household items in the United States.Telephones also experienced a similarly accelerated increase in use and technological development after WWII. From its invention by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century  the telephone grew increasingly popular and largely replaced the telegraph by WWII  with approximately 30 million phones in service by 1948. After WWII  telephone use continued to expand quickly and by the 1970s over 100 million phones were in use.The next major advancement in telephone communication came in the 1990s with the proliferation of the cellular phone. Though portable and in-vehicle phones had been experimented with since the 1940s  the first true cellular phones (that is  one that pedestrians could carry with them) did not arrive until the 1980s  and even then they were relatively large  clunky objects and were too expensive for the average person. This changed in the 1990s as cell phones got smaller  faster  and cheaper.The proliferation of text messaging in the early 2000s turned the cellular phone into a multi-use tool. The creation of the smartphone  and most notably Apple's iPhone  which essentially turned the cell phone into a computer as well  has completely changed the cell phone  putting access to a world of information on a device which only a couple decades ago was used merely for making telephone calls.TransportationThe world of transportation has seen similar improvements in technology since WWII  though not nearly the same level of innovation. Indeed  our main modes of transportation - automobile  airplane  train  or ship - are still the same  though they have all undergone serious transformations to improve safety and efficiency.The world of automobiles  for example  remained largely unchanged for the first century of its existence  but in the past quarter century  environmental awareness and the high price of oil and gasoline has spurred research and development in cars fueled by alternative sources of fuel. All major auto companies now either have an electric car being developed or on the road  and all have successful gas/electric hybrid models  such as the Toyota Prius or the Ford Fusion Hybrid.Air travel has made more significant advances since WWII with the advent of the jet engine in the 1950s. Prior to the jet engine  all planes were prop-engines  which used large propellers to generate the speed and air flow over the wings necessary for flight. The jet engine provided enormous amounts of thrust  which made the propeller obsolete  though it should be noted many prop planes are still in service today.With the jet engine  planes could now fly farther and faster and carry larger loads. Since WWII commercial air travel has exploded in popularity and safety on airlines has gotten increasingly better - as of this writing in early 2014  the United States' domestic airlines (think Delta  United  or American Airlines) have gone over four years without a major crash.,Science and Technology

vcScJq5s2vw,Sumerian Advanced Ancient Technology Inventions New Documentary 2018,The civilizations of Ancient Mesopotamia brought many astounding advances in the areas of science and technology. In this excellent new documentary Kingdoms of Sumeria ‘The Legacy of Sumerian Scientists’ we take on some of the biggest enigmas of the Sumerians  in our journey so far. Many will know of certain Sumerian and Babylonian scientific curiosities and their inventions  but what is the origins of these scientific endeavours? Astonishing evidence now shows Sumerian science was high  it was preserved in later cultures  and it was unprecedented. Kingdoms of Sumeria were vast domains all connected through a trade network  which in this episode is shown through the Sumerian Science Endeavours. The most insightful of all is the roots in Armenia  which many scholars shy away from.© Nabonidus Media,Science and Technology

BT894WBoRJ8,Science  Technology  & Society Program: A 21st Century Perspective,The presentation is based upon a recent literature review that intends to highlight some of the critical research that has been synthesized on the perspectives of both teachers and students and their attitudes to teaching and learning in an STS-themed learning environment. The first portion of the presentation draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes  as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. While much of the research has been focused on the need for additional remedial training for teachers and the use of assessment  the presentation will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS  it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum. The conclusion of the presentation will also aim to indicate disparities still present in the growing body of STS research and areas of future focus.Steven AutieriTeacher  Science Department  East Haven High School East Haven  CT  USA Aidin AmirshokoohiAssistant Professor of STEM EducationDeSales UniversityCenter Valley  PA  USA,Science and Technology

d6dxWNQj1GU,Most AMAZING Recent Technology!,Check out the most amazing recent technology! This top 10 list of recent futuristic inventions and cool gadgets from the future is absolutely amazing!  Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our "Most INCREDIBLE Coin Discoveries Around The World!" video here: https://youtu.be/_BcTxPHP6GwWatch our "Most AMAZING Places Around The World!" video here: https://youtu.be/a3l6iREKgAkWatch our "Most Amazing Cities Found UNDERWATER!" video here: https://youtu.be/rUqxhYJqGhU#12 3D Printing Organs3D printing has been around for a few years now  but it just recently made breakthroughs bigger than cars or phone cases or toys that have been created before. The 3D printer has started created organs for human use. Sure  prosthetics are understandable. But organs? Research is currently being conducted on artificial heart  kidney  and liver structures  as well as other major organs. Organs like the heart will be tougher but it is definitely possible. Can you imagine being the person that kept organs in stock? Checking your list...okay I need to print three kidneys and four livers today. The reason the 3D printing works so well is that organs are very complicated and the machine does a layer by layer scan of an actual organ. This allows them to give a very detailed printout.Crazy yes. But not as crazy as the ability to print out human skin! Now that craziness is happening as we speak! This can be to repair damaged skin or purely cosmetic reasons. #11 Needleless Vaccines What is your least favorite part of getting flu shots? Oh yeah  the shot. The needle that pierces your skin and stings.This new invention called the ImmunoMatrix patch will allow you to vaccinate yourself with a simple band-aid like patch. This isn’t just great because it’s painless but has even greater benefits. One: It takes a tenth of the vaccine that the syringe does  which saves tons of money. And two: it doesn’t require the glass vial  syringes  hypodermic needles  trained medical personnel  and biohazardous waste disposal. So again  it saves tons and tons of money.Can you imagine it being flu season and you just going to town to pick up your flu patch and adhering it at home? Dream big…and realistically! This is happening.#10 Endless StorageYou know how a terabyte is really big? Well what about a million terabytes? Maybe a trillion? Okay  now imagine an endless amount of storage! Scientists at the University of Southampton have created and are working on advances with this technology. Not only will this device store endless info  but it is pretty much invincible to damage.It is made out of nanostructured glass and has the ability to record and retrieve five dimensional digital data by femtosecond laser writing.As for right now  it can only hold about 360 TB  but things are quickly escalating there. It can go through almost 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and will last longer than anyone on this planet…except maybe the tardigrade. The technology isn’t for public  use yet because it is reserved for preserving historical documents first  since it can hold an entire library of books! They have already stored actual copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Newton’s Opticks  Magna Carta and Kings James Bible. #9 Wall Climbing FishEver seen a spider climb a wall? What about a monkey? Hmm…well  what about a wall climbing fish?In the Amazon rain forest  just recently  a wall climbing fish has been discovered. This may not seem like a scientific advancement  but in reality  it means everything! This isn’t the only thing odd about these fish  who were oddly enough born in caves only they could see and we’re colorless! This Ecuadorian fish defies gravity as it hikes up a nearly vertical wall for ten feet!It’s called a Chaetostoma microps  and is a suckermouth armoured catfish. You’ve seen suckerfish climb underwater  but out of water is a whole new thing! Scientists are ecstatic to study the technique and maybe use it to create wall climbing gear for engineers. Another thing that makes this discovery an advancement is that it has never been seen in this exact way before. Meaning  it has either learned the ability on its own  as a species  or…there are still many more species still undiscovered by scientists. #8 Cybernetic ImplantsThe term cyberware is a pretty new field for scientists. Sure  the first pacer was implanted in the 1950s  but that was such a small advancement compared to today. We already have an “artificial pancreas” for diabetics. As of now  it is simply a pod implants into the skin by the wearer and pumps insulin into their body. But you see  there are two types of cyberware today.  Brainware and bodyware. You know the datajack from The Matrix? Yeah  like that.

Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture  biomass  ocean wind and salinity  etc. However  until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also  a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.For more lectures on demand visit:http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/in...,Science and Technology

ZX8kJfWzvX4,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),Located in the science and research hub of Daedeok Innopolis in Daejeon  South Korea  the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology has developed into an active institution  often placed among some leading universities in global scientific education and research.KAIST has connotations of academic excellence  innovation and entrepreneurship  but also the launch of large-scale projects. The university often ranks highly among other universities of a similar age.KAIST was established in February 1971 as Korea Advanced Institute of Science  with a loan given by United States Agency for International Development. The university aimed not only to educate young researchers in science and engineering  but also to provide a solid basis for the development of future higher education institutions in Korea.Its structure was created by an international team  which included the American electrical engineer and vice-president of Stanford University Frederick Emmons Terman. Unlike other public institutions in South Korea  KAIST has freedom to decide upon its entry requirements and course structure  which gives the university a special status.Today  KAIST has a rich academic portfolio in disciplines such as physics  mathematics  engineering  humanities and social sciences  business and management. The courses are delivered by 6 colleges and 2 schools  with over 33 divisions. KAIST’s unique institutes include the National NanoFab Center  which conducts research into nano-devices and their potential applications.KAIST consists of 2 major campuses situated in Daejeon and South Korea’s capital Seoul. They offer over 25 dormitories  4 libraries and a medical centre. To ensure students are actively engaged in the campus cultural events  the university organises traditional opera and jazz recitals.Some of the most famous KAIST former faculty members and graduates are the electrical engineer Soon-dal Choi  mathematician Gi-hyong Gho and the physicist Chang Hee Nam.Subsribe on Happy Traveler - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7V...,Science and Technology

SebwliURwU4,Machines Of Ancient China - Full Documentary,The history of science and technology in China is both long and rich with many contributions to science and technology. In antiquity  independently of Greek philosophers and other civilizations  ancient Chinese philosophers made significant advances in science  technology  mathematics  and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets  solar eclipses  and supernovae were made in China. Traditional Chinese medicine  acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced.Among the earliest inventions were the abacus  the "shadow clock " and the first flying machines such as kites and Kongming lanterns. The four Great Inventions of ancient China: the compass  gunpowder  papermaking  and printing  were among the most important technological advances  only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages. The Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 906) in particular  was a time of great innovation. A good deal of exchange occurred between Western and Chinese discoveries up to the Qing Dynasty.,Science and Technology

pIsPVFvdeWQ,Food Science | Norman Potter 5th Edition-Book Review,Food Science by Norman Potter - Book Review. Here's a review of one the best and famous textbooks for the students of Food Science and Food Technology. In this video  I have reviewed Food Science by Norman Potter - 5th edition. ********************************************************************Amazon Link for Food Science Book - https://amzn.to/2QhslkO ********************************************************************Amazon link for Objective Food Science by S. K. Sharma -https://amzn.to/2Nxe6KL Best part about this book - It covers most of the basic concepts of food science and technology. There’s a famous quote from a man – “If you are an expert in your field  you won’t have to run after opportunities  rather the opportunities will come running after you”.Now if you want to be an expert in food science or food technology  you’ll have to take small steps every day. And this book by Norman Potter will provide you a strong foundation to build the basic concepts of food science and technology. Now  food science by Norman Potter is the one of the best books for any student who’s pursuing a major/degree in food science/technology. The authors of this book – N. Potter & Joseph Hotchkiss have been Professors in the Department of Food Science at the Cornell University  in New York. Cornell University has one of the oldest departments of food science in the world and this university ranks amongst top 20 universities all over the world. So  this book has a pretty solid background. This book is not only going to be helpful for you in the first/second year  but this book is also going to provide you some reference & some insight even in your whole graduation even in your post-graduation. I refer to this book even now. There are 25 chapters and the book is about 600 pages.  Price ranges from 450-490 [Usually stays below 500]. Most of the faculties and most of the professors refer to this textbook because of its versatility and coverage of the basic concepts as well. And this is why I highly recommend for you to study  to read this book  to understand the concepts of this book. To build a strong foundation of Food Science and technology so that you can build an expertise in the food industry and in the academics of your college. *********************************************************************-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: "What Is Food Safety & Why You Need to Know About It?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQLvn...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~- https://amzn.to/2CHMhaH,Science and Technology

RxmzCJug9HE,Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT,Disasters such as earthquakes  typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community’s ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for  respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities  but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley  where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai’s research interests are social vulnerability analysis  megacity and urban risk  and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI)  he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul  Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

UUvzq6OQWdk,CHINA: BEIJING: NEW SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY MUSEUM,Keyword-science-technologyMandarin/NatA new science and technology museum in Beijing is luring crowds of Chinese of all ages eager to peer into the future and get hands-on experience with devices which may well transform their lives at some future date.The exhibition is in keeping with the belief of China's leaders that adopting the latest technology and improved quality of life go hand in hand.It is hoped the museum will be a catalyst for China's own scientific developments.It was not even the official big opening for Beijing's new Science and Technology Museum but the size of the crowds said it all.It is clear that the Chinese are enthusiastic about technology and impatient to embrace all the exciting innovations that science can bring.Futuristic forms of transport like this magnetic levitating train may one day be the main mode of transport between Beijing and Shanghai.The museum is very user friendly - people can touch and operate most of the machines  and special transparent casings show everyone how things work.Displays are designed to stimulate the imagination - this exhibit offers the experience of a walk on the moon.SOUNDBITE: (Mandarin)"I was out of control. I bounced up and down and had lots of fun."SUPER CAPTION:  Liu Rui Yi  'moon walker'And for those who prefer to fly closer to Earth  there's a flight simulator where would-be pilots can test their skills.A sportsman would have a hard job beating this fellow at basketball - the mechanical marvel with golden arms never misses a shot.Soccer enthusiasts were shown how to play the game virtually via computer programmes which provide an instant match - without even leaving the house or having to get a team together.And for those who fancy a tightrope ride across the Grand Canyon but without the risk - this is the ride for you.The museum covers over 22-thousand square metres of floor space and contains 340 displays of past  present and future science and technology.The Cold War may be over but children visiting the museum are reminded that the United States holds the military high ground with tactical bombers like the B-1 which can evade attack through the use of stealth technology.Even so  simulated dog fights can still be won by the most determined fighter pilots.SOUNDBITE: (Mandarin)"I will launch a missile to strike it."SUPER CAPTION: Di NuoExperts are on hand in the museum to explain some of the more significant scientific discoveries  such as electricity  which can be tamed and transformed in a comic example of man's ability to harness the forces of nature.Some of the larger displays are enclosed for the sake of safety.From a distance  audiences can watch the generation and delivery of power  recreated in a scale model.Robotics can be used not only to relieve man of the burden of heavy labour but also to entertain.This mechanical conductor directs a mechanical band in a popular tune.The architecture of the museum itself reflects a scientific theme in the use of the double-helix structure of D-N-A.The Science and Technology Museum will officially open to the general public on 29 April and the entrance fee will be the equivalent of about one dollar.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...

Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)The first annual Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering lecture about communicating complex scientific and technological subjects clearly and engagingly in the series : Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century.Recorded on 9/12/12,Science and Technology

kBgXnjEpD7M,Naked Science - Roman Tech,Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1Every other Wednesday we present a new video  so join us to see the truth laid bare...What did the Romans do for us?They invented the modern world.  Modern cities  modern warfare  modern living all first came together in ancient Rome.  The Romans were the first superpower  controlling around a quarter of the world’s population.  This film looks at how they used technology to hold together their empire.  We see the ingenious pilum  a spear cleverly designed so that the enemy couldn’t throw it back; the scorpion  a bolt-firing weapon of war; and the rock-hurling ballista  the fore-runner of modern artillery.We learn how they built their roads  the arteries of the empire that  put end to end  would stretch twice around the world.  Roman cities  with their grid pattern  paved the way for the cities of today.  They had hot baths  central heating  flushing toilets and double-glazing.  They built apartment blocks 8 stories high  and to entertain their citizens built stunning buildings like the Pantheon and Colosseum (or Coliseum).  But holding everything together at the heart of the Empire  was water.  No city can survive without a supply of drinking water.  Great aqueducts carried water into Rome from springs 11 miles away.  When the planners of New York were building their water system  they travelled to Italy to copy the Romans.,Science and Technology

tQd_5as_cMY,Humans  Gods and Technology - VPRO documentary - 2017,What will our world look like 25 years from now? Watch this lecture about the meaning of life shaped by technology in a near future.Nobody knows how our world will look like in 25 years. Perhaps our work is taken over by autonomous robots and we become the slaves of the technology we have created ourselves. The big questions about the future of man and his relation to technology are presented to two important thinkers of the moment: Kevin Kelly and Yuval Noah Harari.Kevin Kelly is a writer of influential works such as What Technology Wants and The Inevitable. Kelly sketches the inevitability of technology and even sees technology as an autonomous evolutionary system. Artificial intelligence becomes commonplace for everyone and will help us analyze difficult issues and challenge them to reflect on who we are. Kelly is convinced that we are already seen as Gods by technology and that robots will also believe in their own Gods.Yuval Noah Harari is a writer of books about the history of Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus. Harari sketches the history of tomorrow and analyzes the way in which we create our own illusions; illusory institutions such as religion  states and money. We believe in gods because we want to be them ourselves. Harari sees a society with inequalities where some people can upgrade themselves to gods and others will remain vulnerable and mortal.Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2017.© VPRO Backlight October 2017On VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles  French subtitles and Spanish subtitles  such as documentaries  short interviews and documentary series.VPRO Documentary publishes one new subtitled documentary about current affairs  finance  sustainability  climate change or politics every week.

tqKpk1wABuI,Top 10 most Amazing Technologies,1)google smart glass :-Welcome to Smart-Glasses.org! We are proud to provide information and resources about smart glasses and smart technology. We hope you find the information provided here useful as we continue to explore new emerging technology.Once the realm of science fiction movies  computer technology has moved to glasses  and multiple companies are making plans for this emerging mobile peripheral wireless market. The first smart glasses are projected to be available in the summer to fall of 2012 with other companies potentially releasing their versions by the end of 2012. Smart glasses will incorporate a bright high-definition display  adjustable for outdoor use on the glass lens so that the images appear as if they were in the exterior world. They will also have Internet connectivity and multiple new applications. Some of the displayed images will have a holographic quality to them  depending upon the smart glass manufacturer  making the image appear as if it were real and in front of the smart glasses2)leap motion:-The Leap Motion controller is a small USB peripheral device which is designed to be placed on a physical desktop  facing upward. Using two monochromatic IR cameras and three infrared LEDs  the device observes a roughly hemispherical area  to a distance of about 1 meter (3 feet). The LEDs generate a 3D pattern of dots of IR light[14] and the cameras generate almost 300 frames per second of reflected data  which is then sent through a USB cable to the host computer  where it is analyzed by the Leap Motion controller software using "complex math" in a way that has not been disclosed by the company  in some way synthesizing 3D position data by comparing the 2D frames generated by the two cameras.[15][16]The smaller observation area and higher resolution of the device differentiates the product from the Kinect  which is more suitable for whole-body tracking in a space the size of a living room.[17] In a demonstration to CNET  The Leap was shown to perform tasks such as navigating a website  using pinch-to-zoom gestures on maps  high-precision drawing  and manipulating complex 3D data visualizations.[17] Leap Motion CEO Michael Buckwald told CNET:Leap Motion initially distributed thousands of units to developers who are interested in creating applications for the device. The Leap Motion controller was first shipped in July  20133)3D printing :-3D printing or Additive manufacturing[1] is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process  where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes.[2] 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques  which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).A 3D printer is a limited type of industrial robot that is capable of carrying out an additive process under computer control.While 3D printing technology has been around since the 1980s  it was not until the early 2010s that the printers became widely available commercially.[3] The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp.[4] Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines  and their price has dropped substantially.[5] According to Wohlers Associates  a consultancy  the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012  up 29% from 2011.[6]The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture  construction (AEC)  industrial design  automotive  aerospace  military 4)transparent phone :-processor - which is said to be faster than the current Apple A4 processor. One more rumor about the iPhone 5 is that it will come in two variants - one with a QWERTY keyboard. But one source says that the iPad 3 will have the A6 processor - is the macroscalar processor the same?Which begs the question: "Will the iPhone 5 have the same CPU - or an A5?" A patent search does reveal that Apple is the owner of five patents of the macroscalar processor architecture. The latest is 8 065 502 and is dated November 22  2011. Apple may even hold the copyright on the term as it appears to be new to our language. The new CPU concept seems to be a "looped parallel program 6)flying car new technology :-Flying car technology is turning a dream into reality,Science and Technology

SA8PlvH0TIc,Science and technology in Israel - Israel's technological achievements,Science and technology in Israel By SearchCide Video Technologies :  searchcide@gmail.com . Science and Technology in Israel is one of the country's most developed sectors. The percentage of Israelis engaged in scientific and technological inquiry  and the amount spent on research and development in relation to gross domestic product   is the second highest in the world. Israel ranks thirteenth in the world in scientific activity as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. In 2009 Israel's percentage of the total number of scientific articles published worldwide was almost 10 times higher than its percentage of the world's population. The high technology industry has been successful due to Israel's disproportionately high number of engineers and scientists. Israel boasts the highest number of scientists  technicians  and engineers per capita in the world with 140 scientists  technicians  and engineers per 10 000 employees. In comparison  the same is 85 per 10 000 in the United States and 83 per 10 000 in Japan.Israeli scientists have contributed to the advancement of agriculture  computer sciences  electronics  genetics  health care  optics  solar energy and various fields of engineering. Israel is home to major players in the high tech industry and has one of the world's most technologically literate populations. In 1998  Tel Aviv was named by Newsweek as one of the ten most technologically influential cities in the world. Since 2000  Israel has been a member of EUREKA  the pan-European research and development funding and coordination organization  and held the rotating chairmanship of the organization for 2010–2011. In 2010  the journalist David Kaufman  wrote that the high tech area of Yokneam  Israel has the "world's largest concentration of aesthetics-technology companies".Google's Chairman Eric Schmidt complimented the country during a visit there  saying that “Israel has the most important high-tech center in the world after the US.” Israeli companies excel in computer security technologies  semiconductors and communications. Israeli firms include Check Point  a leading firewall firm; Amdocs  which makes business and operations support systems for telecoms; Comverse  a voice-mail company; and Mercury Interactive  which measures software performance. A high concentration of high-tech industries in the coastal plain of Israel has led to the nickname Silicon Wadi (lit: "Silicon Valley"). Both Israeli and international companies are based there. Intel and Microsoft built their first overseas research and development centers in Israel  and other high-tech multi-national corporations  such as IBM  Cisco Systems  and Motorola  have opened facilities in the country. Intel developed its dual-core Core Duo processor at its Israel Development Center in Haifa. More than 3 850 start-ups have been established in Israel  making it second only to the US in this sector and has the largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies outside North America.Optics  electro-optics  and lasers are significant fields and Israel produces fiber-optics  electro-optic inspection systems for printed circuit boards  thermal imaging night-vision systems  and electro-optics-based robotic manufacturing systems. Research into robotics first began in the late 1970s  has resulted in the production of robots designed to perform a wide variety of computer aided manufacturing tasks  including diamond polishing  welding  packing  and building. Research is also conducted in the application of artificial intelligence to robots.science and technology introduction   israel's technological achievements   technologies developed in israel   israel scientific achievements   israel technological advancements   technological factors israel,Science and Technology

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques  processes  and the like  or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food  and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times  including the printing press  the telephone  and the Internet  have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

PzPW5msevJ0,15 Recent Science Discoveries You Wont Believe,15 amazing recent discoveries in the world of science and here they are from bionic contact lenses to reanimating dinosaur dna!Subscribe to Talltanic http://goo.gl/wgfvrr7.  New Human SpeciesBiologists all over the world were intrigued upon hearing the 2015 discovery of a new species of human  Homo Naledi  allowing for an ever clearer picture of our ancient ancestry.  The findings were unveiled deep in an underground cave in South Africa and is considered one of the greatest collection of human remains ever unearthed.  So far  it is known that this species of human grew to an average height of 5 feet and had a brain no larger than an orange.  The way the bones in the South African cave were arranged suggests that these human ancestors ritualistically buried their dead  giving scientists a glimpse into our cultural past.6.  Bionic LensWhile still in the testing stage  the founder of Ocumetics Technology Corp may have stumbled upon a revolutionary technology that could augment the way humans perceive the world.  A new bionic contact lens will give wearers an ability to see the world with stronger than 20/20 vision.  Some subjects  who have already tried the lens themselves  claim that they not only see better than ever before but have identified a unique spectrum of colors unfamiliar to the unaided eye.  Is this perhaps the first step in the direction of a new era of superhumans?5.  Harder Than Diamond Scientists may have recently discovered a substance harder than diamond  Q-carbon.  What gives diamonds their excellent hardness are the chemical bonds that hold them together.  The carbon in diamonds is held together by incredibly tight chemical bonds at the microscopic level  giving diamonds their prominent hardness.  By the manipulation of carbon atoms  scientists were able to augment their chemical bonds  producing a material that is potentially 60 times harder than diamond.  While this substance is still being experimented on  it is a potential prospect for the future of cheap  efficient technologies.4.  First MammalsResearchers from the University of Edinburgh have discovered an ancient species of mammals that survived the notorious extinction of the dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The reason this find is so significant is that it gives us a glimpse at how mammals began to rule the world previously dominated by their cold-blooded counterparts.  The mammal is thought to have been a plant-eater closely resembling a modern beaver.  Once the dinosaurs were eliminated these beaver-like creatures began to flourish  given that they were no longer victims of dinosaur predators.  Because these little guys were able to withstand the destruction that wrecked havoc on the dinosaurs  an array of mammals  including our ancestors  were finally able to leave their mark on the world. 3.  Whale Gene MappingGene mapping is starting to look less like a theoretical nicety and more like an applied science with this new aquatic discovery.  Scientists have finally discovered why Bowhead Whales are able to live to 200 years old by remapping their entire genome.  By comparing the genome of Bowhead Whales with the genome of other mammals with a less impressive lifespan  scientists were able to point out marked differences.  Bowhead longevity is due to its genes’ effectiveness in repairing gene deterioration  which is the cause of cancer and other ailments known to cut human life short.  By further studying this animal’s genes  scientists may finally be able to restore our own faulty genetic system  substantially lengthening our lives. 2.  Second Earth NASA has recently confirmed their discovery of a possible second Earth.  Kepler-452b orbits its sun in what scientists call the “Goldilocks Zone ” which is the habitable region in space  not too far or close to the sun  necessary for the possibility of life to flourish.  The new planet appears to have a rocky surface as well as liquid water  which is another key ingredient for life to subsist.  Although not much is known about if there is life beyond Earth  it makes sense to take notice of planets similar to our own.1.  Animal Re-animationScientists have always been intrigued by the prospect of re-animating creatures that have been extinct for many years.  While bringing a dinosaur back to life would be kind of cool  bringing a Wooly Mammoth back to life would be just as cool  and that is just what scientists are trying to do.  Because Wooly Mammoths and Saber-Toothed Tigers have only been extinct for tens of thousands of years  unlike the millions of years dinosaurs have been extinct  intact DNA samples are much easier to find.  Scientists believe it is possible to recreate these extinct beasts by cloning them with DNA and tissue samples  which have been found  over the years  preserved in ice.,Science and Technology

X5fhVLJs9go,William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses,Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys – liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers  they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades  exhibit unique thermal  mechanical  and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.William L. Johnson  the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech  joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez  the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's  he  along with Ricardo Schwarz  discovered solid-state amorphization  leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses  pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science  30  81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods  B7  657 (1985)).This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling  and  in 1993  the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery  characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see  for example  Applied Phys. Letters  63  2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations  including the measurement of thermal  mechanical  optical  electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation  and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.His research has lead to commercial success  too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies  in Lake Forrest California  which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name "LiquidMetal Golf"). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry  as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification  and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics  and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature  and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy  NASA  and corporations. Over the past two decades  he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy  NASA  the National Science Foundation  and the National Academy of Engineering.http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/306...,Science and Technology

XniKEtFVZco,Science  Technology  & Society Program: A 21st Century Perspective,The presentation is based upon a recent literature review that intends to highlight some of the critical research that has been synthesized on the perspectives of both teachers and students and their attitudes to teaching and learning in an STS-themed learning environment. The first portion of the presentation draws on the perspectives of elementary and secondary school teachers both locally and abroad. The information collected is intended to illustrate some of the major successes  as well as barriers to implementation in several different classrooms. While much of the research has been focused on the need for additional remedial training for teachers and the use of assessment  the presentation will present data focusing on the overall attitude and educational successes of students that participate in an STS-enriched learning environment. By examining the current research on STS  it is expected that a clear picture will be created demonstrating the place of STS in the overall science curriculum. The conclusion of the presentation will also aim to indicate disparities still present in the growing body of STS research and areas of future focus.Steven Autieri--Teacher  Science Department  East Haven High School East Haven  CT  USAAidin Amirshokoohi--Science Education Researcher & Curriculum Analyst Avicenna Institute of Science Teaching & Learning Reading  PA  USA,Science and Technology

Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.[1] These demands include buildings  aircraft  vessels  and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands  the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively. To accomplish this  managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally  these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.Read more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enginee...May you find this video informative and be thrilled to subscribe for more.

The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off  the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today  doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.Within three minutes  the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch  a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster  carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car.

Y6zDhH160Wg,Technology vs Modern Science,Go to UniversalModel.com to learn more.From Volume I of  Universal Model  A New Millennial Science  on page 57 we find the following difference between Science and Technology:"Scientific leaders recognize the difficulty in getting the public excited over natural science but they also understand the importance of gaining their support. Popularity drives the funding for new research  a multi-billion dollar proposition in America today. How do you convince the public to fund unpopular theoretical research? Over the past several decades  there has been a growing trend to group science and technology into the generic category of ‘science.’ This largely successful effort has effectively blurred the line between them and few people recognize their important differences. One difference remains significant—science has not enjoyed the success that technology has.We recognize one example in the bestselling American science magazine  Scientific American. During the last two decades  it has become increasingly difficult for science journals and magazines to fill their pages with purely scientific discoveries and stories to maintain readership. On the other hand  technological journals and magazines have grown exponentially  graced with abundant technological discoveries and stories. Scientific American recognized this  and several years ago  the magazine announced to its readers it was changing its format to include new sections dedicated to technology."In one instance  they presented twenty World Changing Ideas in the December 2009 issue  to “build a cleaner  healthier  smarter world” (page 50). Of the twenty ideas  only three were science-based. The remaining seventeen were technology-based. This ratio of 3/20 science-based ideas is probably typical of the science-verses-technology circumstance that exists today. There are many more successful technological inventions than there are new scientific discoveries. Most new scientific discoveries (such as those in astronomy and biology) are often a direct result of technological advances in telescopes  DNA testing  and other equipment and procedures. Often times  these new techno-related discoveries contradict existing theories  a topic we approach in later chapters.  In another text  the “power of science” is mingled with “technologies”:“The power of science cannot be denied: it has given us computers and jets  vaccines and thermonuclear bombs  technologies that  for better or worse  have altered the course of history.”  End of Science  John Horgan  P.4  1996"Computers  jets  and bombs are NOT science  but are technological inventions. We can find examples like this  where science and technology incorrectly mingle outcomes in almost every science related book  magazine  or newspaper."Music:Alan Walker - Fade [NCS Release]https://youtu.be/bM7SZ5SBzyYMaterial for this video was prepared according to the fair use laws of the United States.

_fEBWkowuDI,India's Ancient Sciences & Technological Innovations Rediscovered Documentary 2017,India's Ancient Sciences & Technological Innovations Rediscovered Documentary 2017India is one of the oldest and richest civilizations in the world. It is home to the world's first planned cities  where every house had its own bathroom and toilet five thousand years ago. The Ancient Indians have not only given us yoga  meditation and complementary medicines  but they have furthered our knowledge of science  maths - and invented Chaturanga  which became the game of chess.According to Albert Einstein  they "taught us how to count"  as they invented the numbers 1-9 and 'zero'  without which there would be no computers or digital age. Unfairly we call this system of counting Arabic numbers - a misplaced credit.Two thousand years ago the Indians pioneered plastic surgery  reconstructing the noses and ears on the faces of people who had been disfigured through punishment or warfare. They performed eye operations such as cataract removal and invented inoculation to protect their population from Smallpox  saving thousands of lives.,Science and Technology

V9xZFZ07UbA,The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2018,The Internet Revolution and Digital Future Technology Documentary 2018The history of the Internet begins with the development of electronic computers in the 1950s. Initial concepts of wide area networking originated in several computer science laboratories in the United States  United Kingdom  and France.When the Internet was invented?ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1  1983  and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990  when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.When did people start using the Internet?On 6 August 1991  the World Wide Web went live to the world. There was no fanfare in the global press. In fact  most people around the world didn't even know what the Internet was. Even if they did  the revolution the Web ushered in was still but a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye.When did the Internet originate?Find out here. The internet began life in 1969  when scientists working for the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA  now known as DARPA) connected computer networks at the University of California and the Stanford Research Institute.Which country first invented the Internet?The internet protocols (TCP/IP) happened following initiatives takes by the US Government. The world-wide-web was invented by a British guy (while working at Cern) This brought us HTTP and websites. His work was inspired by the idea of hypertext. Hypertext as a concept had been bouncing around for a while.What was the original purpose of the Internet?Many people have heard that the Internet began with some military computers in the Pentagon called Arpanet in 1969. ... Bob Taylor  the Pentagon official who was in charge of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (or Arpanet) program  insists that the purpose was not military  but scientific.Please SUBSCRIBE & SHARE.https://goo.gl/sGXNEfWatch more documentaries:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...,Science and Technology

You’d be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can’t explain today.  If you’re ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more  then keep on watching.

Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice  a kid’s toy  a candle holder  a simple decoration  a measuring device on the battlefield  or an astronomical instrument  to name a few.-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that’s because they were the best swords at the time.-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period  which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form  but it is strange that there isn’t more.-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1 000 C.E.  but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn’t come around until 800 years later.-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal  astrological  balneological  and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.-In 132 C.E.  Zhang Heng  a Chinese inventor  astronomer  engineer  scientist  scholar  and artist  invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth’s movements.-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed “the world’s first analog computer” and it was made around 200 B.C.E.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/,Science and Technology

Majors take four core classes in STS: philosophy  history  and either public policy or anthropology of science and technology.Science  Technology and Society is an international journal devoted to the study of science and technology in social context.Drawn from a variety of disciplines  including anthropology  history  political science  and sociology  scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology. Unlike scholars in science studies  history of technology  or the history and philosophy of science  they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate  "ivory tower" researchers[citation needed].

sX1Y2JMK6g8,SpaceX Falcon Heavy- Elon Musk's Engineering Masterpiece [Updated Version],Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight  carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off  the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today  doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor.Within three minutes  the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch  a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads.Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster  carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car  nicknamed Starman.MUSIC CREDITS:-  "Hero Memories" by Really Slow MotionComposer: Fran SotoAlbum: SigmaYoutube link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSgjJ...Buy Really Slow Motion musicAmazon : http://amzn.to/1lTltY5iTunes: http://bit.ly/1ee3l8KSpotify: http://bit.ly/1r3lPvNBandcamp: http://bit.ly/1DqtZSoFOOTAGE CREDITS:-00:00-00:06 00:35-00:41 01:33-01:35 The Vergechannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVergevideo link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7LJI...00:47-00:49 & 03:25- Anthony Garciachannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJc...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhhPs...01:19-01:20 03:13-03:15-bombcat91Channel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aW...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znVWV...01:22-01:24- videodroneChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Kz...video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGbH...03:11- The cooper ScoopChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKR...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncSDV...Footage at 03:26-03:28 & voice at 03:23-03:37-Das valdez(KSpace Academy)Twitch: http://twitch.tv/dasvaldezYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLd...Full Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw3KE...03:28-03:30- Physics AnonymousChannel link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzu3...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tikak...03:32-Emmerich Video ProductionsChannel Link:- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkP...Video link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMCC0...Elon Musk's Statement courtesy:- 00:20-00:34- The Verge00:46-00:54- CNNMoney#ElonMusk #SpaceX #FalconHeavy,Science and Technology

rNV-yKJWQC8,SpaceX- Rewind 2018: A Year To Remember,SpaceX Rewind 2018:-Building off its earlier momentum—8 launches in 2016 and 18 in 2017  SpaceX pulled off 21 launches in 2018  a staggering achievement for the 16-year-old company. SpaceX’s reusable rocket technology moved out of the proof-of-concept stage to become the backbone of a growing fleet of flight-proven rockets. Although the company landed its first rocket in 2015  it took until 2017 for SpaceX to reuse its first booster. This year landings became almost routine  and engineers bid farewell to the moderately reusable Falcons of yesterday  ushering in an era of more capable Falcons  dubbed the Block 5.Another long-standing goal was to debut its heavy-lift rocket  the Falcon Heavy. First estimated to fly back in 2013  the Falcon Heavy took its inaugural flight on Feb. 6th. After sending a cherry red Tesla roadster (complete with Starman pilot) on a journey past Mars  the three cores of the Falcon Heavy—each essentially its own Falcon 9 rocket—returned to Earth. Two of the boosters touched down in perfect synchronization on LZ-1 and LZ-2  SpaceX’s designated landing zones at Cape Canaveral. The Heavy’s center booster  however  missed its targeted landing spot on a waiting drone ship  and plopped into the Atlantic Ocean.Musk announced that Yusaku Maezawa was the mysterious billionaire who had reserved both seats the first paying customer on SpaceX’s next-generation rocket—the BFR. Billed from the start as an interplanetary transport vehicle  BFR (which is composed of two parts  a rocket and a spaceship capable of carrying hundreds of people into space)THUMBNAIL CREDITS:-  Joe Burbank  MBOMusic credits :-'Voyager by Jo BlankenburgYoutube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV6Yy...#ElonMusk #SpaceXRewind2018,Science and Technology
iKEuUcLRh2I,The Future Of Transportation - Incredible Technology To Come,You will see what is the future of transportation.Actually our cities have a lot of problems.Smogs pollutions and traffic jams are some of these issues. They prevent a good quality of life in big cities. However there are some proposals to fix these problems. These technologies are the future of transportation.These technologies will change the world forever1-The Mercedes-Benz Future BusWhat urban public transport will look like in the future is shown by the semi-automated city bus with CityPilot – it operates even more safely  efficiently and comfortably than conventional buses. Connectivity plus camera and radar systems with data fusion are catapulting the city bus into the future. Mercedes-Benz is showing this spectacular technology on an equally spectacular technology platform  the Mercedes-Benz Future Bus with CityPilot.The CityPilot is able to recognise traffic lights  communicate with them and safely negotiate junctions controlled by them. It can also recognise obstacles  especially pedestrians on the road  and brake autonomously. It approaches bus stops automatically  where it opens and closes its doors. And not least  it is able to drive through tunnels. The bus will be environment friendly too.2-Transit Elevated Bus :The Transit Elevated Bus (TEB) is a proposed new bus concept where a guided bus straddles above road traffic  giving it the alternative names such as straddling bus  straddle bus  land airbus  or tunnel bus by international media.3- Automated and self-driving carsThese cars will be incredible. No need to drive them because they are self-driving and automated.They will be smart environmment friendly more luxurious  prettier and safer for everyone.4- Elon Musk underground tunnel systemsThis is firstly proposed to reduce traffic jams in Los Angeles.An incredible underground system of tunnels will connect the city.The vehicles will ride on a big skate that will go at 200 km per hour.This is a good solution to reduce traffic.5 -Hyperloop Another incredible vision of Elon Musk. The system will operate like Maglev do but inside big tube. These tube will have low air pressure.Due to this low pression objects will go faster because no force will stop the speed of the object. Capsule travelling inside these tube  could reach a speed of 1200 km per hour. In the future it could be 5000. Several Hyperloop are proposed around the world. The goal is to cut travel time and protect the planet.6-Falcon Big Rocket by Elon MuskThese rocket are used in the rocket tested by SpaceX.But instead to go to mars or space they will be used to travel to a city to another. It will be the fastest travel system ever conceived.The rocket will reach a speed of 5000 km/h. You can go to Paris to Sydney in less than 1 hour. Hong Kong to New Delhi in less than 30 minutes or New York to Los Angeles in 30 minutes too. You will reach any cities around the world in less than 1 hour.7-Airbus Plane for 2050It's just beautiful. None of the plane that fly actually  can compete with it. No words to describe how beautiful it will be.8- Aether Cruise:It  will be the future private jet of rich.Based on an airship platform  the “Aether” cruise experience by UK-based designer Mac Byers allows guests to experience a wider range of destinations in a shorter time  all the while enjoying some of the greatest views imaginable.9- Flying Cars This is the biggest revolution to come. Imagine to have your personal flying car one day. It has been a long time since we wanted them and finally they are coming. Pal-V is the first car available for purchase. Aeromobil 3.0 will come in 2020 and prices start at 1.5 million$. The Terrafugia TF-X will be available in 2020.Ehang 184 will be the first automated flying car and the sales will start in 2020.This is the most interesting moment since the industrial revolutions in past centuries. Technologies are changing our lives but this time for the better. This time was awaited since many decades.Please enjoy the video and share it !Tell me what you think of the video .Thank you for watching the video and subscribe !We do NOT own the video materials and all credits belong to respectful owners.

RpSbgczuqdw,Falcon Heavy Montage [Extended version]- A Momentous Technological Feat,Tens of thousands of spectators made the pilgrimage from across the country & 22 million people around the world on Youtube witnessed the thunderous roar of the SpaceX's new 23-story-tall jumbo rocket as it has blasted off on its first test flight  carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla sports car aiming for an endless trip past Mars. The Falcon Heavy rose from the same launch pad used by NASA nearly 50 years ago to send men to the Moon. With lift-off  the Heavy became the most powerful rocket in use today  doubling the lift-off punch of its closest competitor. Within three minutes  the Falcon Heavy’s two side boosters separated from the central rocket in one of the most critical points of the flight. Some eight minutes after launch  a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads. Flying atop the Falcon Heavy is SpaceX & Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s cherry-red Tesla Roadster  carrying a passenger—sort of. SpaceX revealed last weekend that a mannequin wearing the company’s new spacesuit would ride in the driver’s seat of the electric sports car  nicknamed Starman.MUSIC CREDITS:- "Hero Memories" by Really Slow Motion Composer: Fran SotoAlbum: SigmaYoutube link:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSgjJ...

jha56v5zRLg,2050 INVENTIONS FUTURE || FUTURE INVENTIONS IN HINDI || FUTURE TECHNOLOGY 2050 || TECH PRO,HELLO  GUYS  HOW  R  U  ALL    IN  THIS  VIDEO  IM  TALK  ABOUT  4  FUTURE  INVENTIONS  IN  2050 .An invention is a unique or novel device  method  composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.Some inventions can be patented. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.Another meaning of invention is cultural invention  which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others.[1] The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.[2] Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge  experience or capability.Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological (including medicine)  sociopolitical (including economics and law)  and humanistic  or cultural.Scientific-technological inventions include railroads  aviation  vaccination  hybridization  antibiotics  astronautics  holography the atomic bomb  computing  the Internet  and the smartphone.Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws  institutions  and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British Parliament  the US Constitution  the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades  the Boy Scouts  the Red Cross  the Olympic Games  the United Nations  the European Union  and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  as well as movements such as socialism  Zionism  suffragism feminism  and animal-rights veganism.DONT   FORGET  HIT  : L-I-K-ES-H-A-R-ES-U-B-S-C-R-I-B-EAFFILIATE  LINKS :MY  SET  UP :MY  PHONE : http://amzn.to/2n85SZRMY  COMPUTER : http://amzn.to/2Gcqg4IFOR  YOUTUBERS :BEST  MIC  FOR  YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2E3psybBEST CAMERA FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n7AF8KBEST LAPTOP FOR YOUTUBERS : http://amzn.to/2n3F78ESOCIAL  LINKS  :FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/GuriKhindaOf...INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/guri_khinda...CONTACT  FOR  SPONSORSHIP : TARSEM9464@GMAIL.COMYOU  SHOULD  WATCH  THIS  : 11 .

d36M4CCCXRw,Discover Tomorrow's Connected Home!,In your connected home of the future  everything will work in harmony to meet your everyday needs  as if by magic... Discover how with Beko  official partner of tomorrow's home. Find out more and pre-order the future on http://www.tomorrowshome.comAt Beko  we're designing your connected home of the future  in which all your appliances work in harmony to anticipate and meet your needs. This future isn't driven by gadgets or gimmicks. It's based on what's genuinely useful in everyday life. It's also not that far away now  so if you're as excited as us  why not pre-order and be the first to enjoy the future?Finally  a fridge that's warm.Your future fridge will be helpful and friendly; it will understand your needs and what else is going on in the house. When you throw away an empty toothpaste tube  for example  your bathroom bin will tell the fridge so it can update your shopping list and re-order automatically. It will also keep track of its own contents and let you know when the milk is about to reach its best-by date  or even suggest recipes based on what's in stock. The connected home should be effortless  pre-empting your needs and chores seamlessly  so you can get on with what really matters.An alarm clock that doesn't alarm you.It's easier and healthier to wake up to natural light rather than to electronic bleeping. Once your future alarm clock and your future blinds start talking  your mornings could become much less painful. The connected home should feel thoughtful and human  designed to be emotionally intelligent  not just cleverly automated.A washer-dryer that also waters your plants.Once everything in your house is connected  you'll see benefits you never expected. The waste water from your washing machine could be filtered and recycled straight to your indoor garden  helping you make both the planet and your living room greener. The connected home should be sustainable  linking appliances to each other and ultimately to your neighbourhood and city to reduce your environmental footprint.Cooking for your kids: good. Teaching them to cook: great!Your future hob will also be a smart display  leading you and your budding chefs through recipes step by step. It will show you where to place pots and pans  and heat them safely through its inductive surface. Giving you all plenty of room to make a happy family mess! The connected home should be relevant to everyday family life  genuinely helpful rather than just technology for the sake of it.A mirror that makes you smile in the morning.Your future bathroom mirror will no longer just stare back at you mutely. It will recognise you and provide you with personalised information and health data. It will also entertain the kids with toothbrushing games  turning a chore into fun. The connected home should be intuitive  and respond to natural gestures and voice in a playful way  not require a thick manual to operate. The ideal appliance? The one you hardly notice.Your oven will save you time and trouble by picking the optimal program for your favourite dishes of its own accord  and looking up the ones it's never tried before. The only thing it won't be able to do is taste them for you. Yet. The connected home's technology and interfaces should be invisible. Ideally they should work without you even noticing.Self-help for housesYour home's Smart Hub will monitor the energy consumption of the hob and other devices  and regulate energy sharing with the neighbourhood grid to save you money. Rather than a dull plastic box  it could appear only when needed on an embedded window display. The connected home should be adaptable and designed to last  updating itself and even taking charge of its own maintenance and repairs.

kiNyRY5s7n8,How to Start a Travel Blog [2019] Travel Blogging Full-Time,Create a Travel Blog Website for Just $3.95++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website  build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016  I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today  I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?Since starting my travel influencer account  I've earned more than $200 000 from a combination of affiliate commission  paid sponsors  adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up  you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel BloggingMy advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all  it's free  unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website  you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time BloggerSetting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:Pick your domain nameSign up for your hosting planInstall WordpressInstall your themeStart bloggingSetup your blog here for just $3.95:++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...// How to Write a Travel BlogThe really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube  I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing  start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.In this video  I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.I’ve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling somethingPaid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white stripsAdsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my websiteFreelancing: taking photos  building websites or providing consulting to small businessesSelling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger// find your speciality- I’ve been blogging full time for 9 years and have taught myself how to code and build sites from scratch. I’ve built websites with 12 million visitors per year  sites with just 50k visitors per month that made $50k in a month and have gone through a ton of website issues and total data losses and this expertise and experience is why I focus on teaching people how to make a website and to me the best place to start is where I started  with bluehost for just $3.95- Now you could copy my strategy  but building up your own credibility and experience will take awhile  plus you’d have to beat me at it :)- So instead  I’d suggest you focus on a product or service where you already have expertise or can build your expertise around- Say you want to be a travel blogger  what’s one thing you’ll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you’d be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you’d be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos  it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray  sunscreen  backup batteries  etc find something you’re interested in and own it// This will be hard  but follow these tips to ensure you succeedIf you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog  let me know in the comments  I reply to every single one.// FOLLOW US: IG: https://www.instagram.com/lifetailored/Wei's IG: https://www.instagram.com/threadtherapy/Couple's IG: https://www.instagram.com/meetthewises/Web: https://lifetailored.com/// Best Vlogging Kit for BeginnersBest Starter Vlogging Camera: Canon 60D: https://fave.co/2wpomKJBest Vlogging Lens: Canon 10-22mm 3.5: https://fave.co/2MDQ807High-End 4K Camera for Photo/Video: Canon 5D Mark IV: https://fave.co/2vaPUTvHigh-End Zoom Lens for Photo/Video/B-roll: Canon 24m-70mm 2.8 II: https://fave.co/2AyMHSD,Travel Blogs

I travelled from Delhi to Bali with Malaysia Airlines. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment  comfortable reclining seats and relished the vegetarian food. Although it would be better if the flagship carrier of Malaysia can offer more variety of food for vegetarians. After reaching Bali  the first target was to get the Visa on arrival.

I hope you enjoyed :)  Where should we travel next?!OPEN FOR ALL INFO AND LINKSSOCIAL MEDIA:Twitter- https://twitter.com/tesschristineInstagram-http://instagram.com/tesschristinexoFacebook- https://www.facebook.com/pages/TessCh....------------------------------------------------------------------------Shot by: https://instagram.com/moderngypsymedia-------------------------------------------------------------------------Watch more of our travel vlogs here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9pKs...-------------------------------Tips: - Take out as much cash you think you will need for the entire trip! On a higher end we would spend about 100 CUC per day on drinks  taxis  tours  food etc. It definitely adds up and goes quickly so be sure to budget!- We filled out/purchased our Visas and certification at the airport. We flew with Delta so make sure you confirm that you can do that the day of with your airline. - Download this app! Trust me it will save you in so many ways. The map on here is amazing and its all "offline" (Just type in "Cuba" in the app store on your phone and its the green one  looks like this) : https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...WHERE WE STAYED: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15752806*Amazing place. Super nice couple that rents it. They gave us a phone that works with their numbers in case and everything is super secure. Great location too! Places we went to:- Plaza De La Cathedral: This is perfect for a photo-op plus it has an inlet street with the Cafe I mentioned and a bunch of resturants- Plaza Vieja: Super pretty  definitely go here for lunch. Great views and a ton of restaurant options with live music. - Parque Central / Paseo Del Prado : This is definitely a must see! You will find the Capitol building  great hotels with rooftop views and a plethora of classic cars to look at or pick one to ride in. - Museum of Revolution : This is a great way to cool off and kill some time. It was once home to Presidents and is beyond beautiful as it was designed by Tiffany & Co.- Hotel National- This is a super fancy hotel with amazing views! We stopped to check it out as a lot of our famous favorites have stayed there. It's definitely a taxi distance away from Old Habana though. Bars:Hotel Inglaterra- This is an amazing rooftop bar with an incredible view! I had my share of sangria's here :) Floridita- One of Hemingway's must stop for a Daiquiri. I really loved these but keep in mind they are 6 CUC a piece compared to 3-4 CUC most other places.La Bodeguita De Medio- Hemingway Bar #2. This was his go-to spot for Mojitos! Beware this is a tourist trap and you might be drinking your mojito on the street depending on the time of the day. Cafe:Cafe De O'Reilly- This was our go-to for breakfast and morning coffee. Try the Cafe Bombon  it was my favorite.Dinner: La Guarida- We found this to be our favorite spot. The restaurant requires reservations  but if you forget like us  you can go up to the roof for amazing sunset views and the best food we had the whole trip! Tips:- The classic cars you see are Taxi's and cost more than the regular cars. You can however rent one for around 20 CUC for an hour city tour. Definitely worth it. Plus they make for great photos ;) - If you are staying in Old Habana  the entire area of Habana Vieja and everything I mentioned is super walkable.Not Sponsored.,Travel Blogs

7V2pJOUe4E4,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Trerice  Cornwall,There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can  reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. By the 16th century the Arundell family had become well-established and was connected by marriage to nearly all the other landed families in Cornwall.The status of the family increased through various members gaining good positions at the Royal court. Their legacy is this grand manor on a Cornish scale. The Arundells inherited Trerice through marriage around 700 years ago. By 1572 John Arundell V had begun building the house we know today. Ten years earlier his income had been boosted by marrying well. Son of the builder of Trerice  Sir John Arundell VI earned the title John for the King due to his role in the Civil War  especially his defence of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth for Charles I. After the restoration of Charles II  Richard Arundell became Baron Arundell in recognition of the support he and his father had given Charles I. We know little about how the Arundell family lived at Trerice. The Arundell line died out in 1768  and Trerice passed to the Aclands. It was the marriage of John  2nd Baron Arundell to Margaret Acland in 1675 that eventually led to the great Devonian family based at Killerton inheriting Trerice. Sir Thomas Dyke Acland never lived at Trerice but often stayed on his political forays into Cornwall. He also used the Great Hall for entertaining. Initially arriving at Trerice as tenants of its last private owner  the Eltons took on the tenancy from the National Trust in 1953. At his own expense  John Elton paid for the repair of the remaining parts of Trerice - and went on to rebuild the fallen north wing. His aim was to create a comfortable family home.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

Sir Thomas Acland wished to have garden and parkland fit for his family.Killerton is an 18th-century house in Broadclyst  Exeter  Devon  England  which  with its hillside garden and estate  has been owned by the National Trust since 1944 and is open to the public. The National Trust displays the house as a comfortable home. On display in the house is a collection of 18th- to 20th-century costumes  originally known as the Paulise de Bush collection  shown in period rooms.The estate covers some 2590 hectares (25.9 km2  6400 acres).Included in the Estate is a steep wooded hillside with the remains of an Iron Age Hillfort on top of it  also known as Dolbury which has also yielded evidence of Roman occupation  thought to be a possible fort or marching camp within the Hillfort.Killerton House itself and the Bear's Hut summerhouse in the grounds are Grade II* listed buildings.The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/c/AndyWrightT...Qigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/c/TrainingThe...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!I thank all of you guys for your kind words and support afterwards - with your help I'm now almost recovered and continue what I love to do: Traveling.#HolaGringo is supported by:Hostelbookers: http://www.hostelbookers.comTraveldudes: http://www.traveldudes.orgFollow me:http://www.back-packer.orghttp://www.twitter.com/BackPackerStevehttp://www.facebook.com/BackPackerBlog,Travel Blogs

sEmMtAVGlJs,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Thomas Hardy's Cottage  Dorchester,Hardy's Cottage is a beautiful secluded place to visit if you are following the Thomas Hardy Trail through Dorset.The cottage  just outside Higher Bockhapmton  was built by Hardy's great-grandfather in 1800 and little has been altered externally since then.It is a popular place for tourists to visit and see where Hardy wrote Under the Greenwood Tree and Far from the Madding Crowd.The cottage is traditionally built from cob and the thatched roof is a wonderful backdrop to the roses  honeysuckle and japonica that climb the walls. Catch the cottage on a sunny Summers day and you won't find a prettier place in Dorset to spend a couple of hours.The cottage stands at the top of the hill off Cuckoo Lane in Higher Bockhampton and behind it stretches Egdon Heath  which Hardy wrote of in 'The Return of the Native'. Take your walking shoes and enjoy a walk through the woods and beyond into Puddletown Forest.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

We also cover off-the-beaten-path outdoor activities you won't find in a typical Naples tourism brochure  Naples itinerary or Naples  Italy city tour also known as Napoli Italia.10 Things to do in Naples  Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript: (NAPOLI)Tell anyone you’re travelling to Naples and you’ll likely get a few raised eyebrows with some side comments about the mafia  or grid-lock traffic  or garbage on the streets. Somewhere along the way  Naples seems to have earned a bad reputation  but we thought it all sounded a bit too harsh. We wanted to experience the city for ourselves  plus we’d also heard there was good pizza! We ended up having a grand ol’ time  so join on us as we show you what you can get up to with a couple of days in Naples  plus somewhere along the way  we’ll also reveal where we ate our favourite pizza. Piazza del Plebiscito seemed like a good place to start our tour. This is a large public square in Central Naples  that earned its name from the 1860 vote that brought Naples into the unified Kingdom of Italy. The plaza is surrounded by numerous attractions  including the Royal Palace of Naples on one side  and the Basilica of San Francesco di Paola.We then visited the Royal Palace of Naples. This was one of the four residences in Naples used by the Bourbon Kings during their rule of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.The admission fee was 4 Euros and this gave us access to the Royal Apartments where we got to admire porcelains  tapestries  sculptures and painted ceilings  found within the palace walls. We visited was Castel Nuovo  an imposing medieval castle that dates back to 1282. This castle was built when Charles I of Naples took the throne and moved his capital from Palermo to Naples.Admission to the castle was 6 Euros per person. We stopped by Caffe Gambrinus  a historic coffeehouse in the heart Naples for a bite and drink. We visited Galleria Umberto I  which is a gallery which vaulted iron and glass ceilings  where you can shop & people watch.This gallery dates back to the late 1880s and meant to be reminiscent of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan.While in Naples  we took it upon ourselves to find the best pizza in the city. This involved eating a total of 10 pizzas over two days. In the end we decided Da Michele was our personal favourite.Because we always enjoy visiting outdoor markets wherever we go  we stopped by the Fish Market.Moving on to museums we visited Naples National Archaeological Museum. This museum holds the Farnese Marbles  which is an impressive collection of Roman copies of classical Greek sculptures and ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum.Another place we visited in Naples was the Quartieri Spagnoli  or Spanish Quarter. The streets in this quarter were laid down during the 16th century for the Spanish military barracks outside the city walls. The streets here are narrow and the buildings tall.And that’s a wrap for our quick 2-day tour of Naples. We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things you can do in the city and all the pizza you can eat in between.This is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food  Italian culture and Italian cuisine.

3iRh8dKu99A,25 things to do in Dublin Travel Guide,So this week we're excited to be exploring Dublin and we're planning to spend an entire week here. This video is going to highlight 25 things to do around the city. Dublin is where most trips in Ireland begin  so before seeing the rest of the country  Audrey and I spent a whole week getting to know the capital. When the weather cooperated we walked around the city  toured Trinity College  and visited the botanical gardens  and when it poured rain as it often does in this part of the world  we just popped into a pub for some Irish stew and a pint of Guinness. The following video will show you a few of the different things to do in Dublin  Ireland.GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/1) Trinity College (Irish: Coláiste na Tríonóide) 2) Phoenix Park (Irish: Páirc an Fhionnuisce)3) Guinness Storehouse4) Grafton Street Shopping District5) Irish Coffee vs Bailey's Coffee (Irish: caife Gaelach)6) National Botanic Gardens (Irish: Garraithe Náisiúnta na Lus)7) Glasnevin Cemetery (Irish: Reilig Ghlas Naíon)8) Experience Gaelic Games (Hurling & Gaelic Football)9) Monument to Oscar Wilde10) Old Jameson Distillery11) The Brazen Head Pub - Oldest Pub in Dublin12) Dublinia Museum13) Saint Patrick's Cathedral (Irish: Ard-Eaglais Naomh Pádraig)14) National Museum of Ireland (Irish: Ard-Mhúsaem na hÉireann)15) Temple Bar16) Nightlife in Dublin17) Irish stew (Irish: stobhach / Stobhach Gaelach)18) Irish Whiskey Museum19) St Stephen's Green (Irish: Faiche Stiabhna) 20) St. Audeon's Gate21) Dublin Castle (Irish: Caisleán Bhaile Átha Cliath)22) Irish Museum of Modern Art (Irish: Áras Nua-Ealaíne na hÉireann) - IMMA23) Kilmainham Gaol (Irish: Príosún Chill Mhaighneann)24) Liffey river walk & Grand canal walk25) St. Michael's TowerOur visit Dublin travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts  entertainment  museums  nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Dublin city guide.25 things to do in Dublin Ireland | Top Attractions Travel Guide Video Transcript:Trinity College was founded in 1592 and it is the oldest university in Ireland. The campus is open to visitors interested in touring the grounds  and you'll also get to hear some fascinating stories of famous students  including the likes of Oscar Wilde  Jonathan Swift  and Bram Stoker. The Guinness Storehouse is Dublin's most popular attraction  and it's a must-visit for beer lovers. The Storehouse covers seven floors surrounding a glass atrium shaped like a pint of Guinness. Inside you'll also find a copy of the 9 000 year lease signed by Arthur Guinness on the brewery site - they won't be going anywhere for a while!Grafton Street is one of the main shopping areas in Dublin. You're likely to find lots of musicians  buskers  and performers along here  plus you get a good vantage point of The Spire. Prior to the establishment of Glasnevin Cemetery  Irish Catholics had no place of their own to bury their dead. This burial ground gave both Irish Catholics and Protestants a place where they could give their dead dignified burial  and it has since become the resting place for people of all religions and non religions.Experience Gaelic Games is a place where you can come and try traditional Irish sports like hurling and Gaelic football.The Old Jameson Distillery is the original site where Jameson Irish Whiskey was distilled until 1971. It is now a visitor centre that offers both guided tours and whiskey tastings.Temple Bar is an area known for its lively nightlife. Located on the southbank of the River Liffey  you'll find all sorts of pubs playing live music once the sun goes down. There's also one pub in Temple Bar  called The Temple Bar  but don't let that confuse you. And that's a wrap for our time in Dublin! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you a few ideas of what the city has to offer. As always  if you have any other suggestions of fun things to do in Dublin as a visitor  feel free to share them in the comments below.

QBamKOviMyk,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Charlecote House and Park  Warwickshire,There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can  reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. Charlecote Park (grid reference SP263564) is a grand 16th-century country house  surrounded by its own deer park  on the banks of the River Avon near Wellesbourne  about 4 miles (6 km) east of Stratford-upon-Avon and 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Warwick  Warwickshire  England. It has been administered by the National Trust since 1946 and is open to the public. It is a Grade I listed building.The Lucy family owned the land since 1247. Charlecote Park was built in 1558 by Sir Thomas Lucy  and Queen Elizabeth I stayed in the room that is now the drawing room. Although the general outline of the Elizabethan house remains  nowadays it is in fact mostly Victorian. Successive generations of the Lucy family had modified Charlecote Park over the centuries  but in 1823  George Hammond Lucy (High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1831) inherited the house and set about recreating the house in its original style.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

Last week Mrs Hakes and I went off to spend four days in Reykjavík  Iceland. It's a wonderful city  and we had an incredible time here. Below is a list of places we went / tour companies we used.To save messing around with a gimbal and camera for the whole time it was entirely shot on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.Everything went extremely smoothly  from the flights to the transfers and the tours - it was perfect!

jJ2zMXfl7Yk,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Nuffield Place  home of William Morris car maker,There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can  reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. In this episode I visit NUFFIELD PLACE  the home of Lord and Lady Nuffield  otherwise known as William Morris of the car name fame. He purchased the home and garden and made it his  by extending and modifying it to suit his needs.Career wise he started as an apprentice bicycle repairer and moved into making them when his request for a pay rise was rejected.  Later  he went into making cars and built the name of Morris around the Cowley area of Oxfordshire.Morris purchased Wolsley in the expansion process and during his lifetime put the profits to good use  donating about £8bn equivalent nowadays to charitable causes in the medical and education arena  such as Nuffield Orthopedic Hospital where I had my second back operation.While scooters were a problem  they made an effort and provided me with a pusher/wheelchair.  I think I got a bit of personal treatment with a guided tour and commentary.The only downfall was the gate to the disabled parking area which would be difficult for solo drivers.-----------------------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

CzdS0hlLQ4w,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Trelissick  Cornwall  house and gardens,There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can  reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. The garden has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1955 when it was donated by Ida Copeland following the death of her son Geoffrey. A stained glass memorial bearing the Copeland Crest remains to this effect in Feock parish church. The house and garden had formerly been owned and developed by the Daniell family  which had made its fortune in the 18th Century Cornish copper mining industry.Many of the species that flourish in the mild Cornish air  including the rhododendrons and azaleas which are now such a feature of the garden  were planted by the Copelands including hydrangeas  camellias and flowering cherries  and exotics such as the ginkgo and various species of palm. They also ensured that the blossoms they nurtured had a wider  if unknowing audience. Mr Ronald Copeland was chairman and later managing director of his family's business  the Spode china factory  and flowers grown at Trelissick were used as models for those painted on ware produced at the works.The Copeland family crest  a horse's head  now decorates the weathervane on the turret of the stable block  making a pair with the Gilbert squirrels on the Victorian Gothic water tower  an echo of the family who lived here in the second half of the 19th century (their ancestor  Sir Humphrey Gilbert  was lost at sea in his tiny ship Squirrel after discovering Newfoundland).The garden is noted for its rare shrubs. It offers a large park  woodland walks  views over the estuary of the River Fal and Falmouth.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

Castle Drogo was originally built between 1910 and 1930 for Julius Drewe  a self-made millionaire whose chain of Home and Colonial Stores enabled him to semi-retire in 1899 at the age of 33. The foundation stone was laid on Drewe's 55th birthday in 1911 and construction took 20 years.Some aspects of the castle are not accessible  but the garden is ramped despite some steep inclines and bumpy surfaces.There is also major roofing works being undertaken at the time of the visit  with a view from above for the abler who can climb stairs.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHhttps://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/AndyWr...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

KUS88AGB0CA,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Tintagel Castle  King Arthur's seat of power,There are 500+ places of interest in the UK under the National Trust banner and I will be attempting to visit as many as I can  reporting as I do all the important stuff relative to accessibility. Tintagel castle is actually English Heritage  so I got my wires crossed and presumed it was NT because the OLD POST OFFICE is just down the road.  I think I may have gone to visit for free  oh well. It was not really very accessible but the guys did their best to get my scooter down the hill to the bottom  at £2 each way. You would need to be able to board a land rover  otherwise  the visit will be impossible.The site of Tintagel Castle has been inhabited at least since the late Roman period  and a community flourished here in the 5th to 7th centuries. In the 12th century Tintagel gained literary fame when Geoffrey of Monmouth named it as the place where King Arthur was conceived. These Arthurian associations may have inspired Richard  Earl of Cornwall  to build a castle at Tintagel in the 1230s  and the enduring legend still ensures Tintagel’s international renown.Additional Music:Ocean by THBD https://soundcloud.com/thbdsultanCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported— CC BY 3.0 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...Music provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/VAz3HfbdKyQ-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - www.arcade-video.co.uk----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

7Hk7PkV-Fb0,Jubril Agoro "How I Really Make Money "  Travel Blogging ?,People keep asking me this:"Jubril  how do you make money and still travel the world?"I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:And you are invited  you can register for free belowhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/Also  some things have really changed.....and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...The number one way I make money is:#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:I come up with the marketing material  write the ads  then run the ad campaigns for them.This is by far the most profitable and believe me  most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...But they're not...You just have to know how to write them.A perfect example is my client Tiffany......she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]My secret?Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]But there’s more...#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays  free travel and 1st class upgrades.All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that’s your thing.

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,With a population of only 300 000  Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth  yet its capital Reykjavik  is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York. Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming  yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However  the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland’s natural beauty  such as the soaring central tower of Hallgrímskirkja. Many of the country’s most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjavík. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland  at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle  an area which encompasses three of Iceland’s greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park  the Geysir Geothermal Field  and Gullfoss. Iceland’s main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world’s most beautiful waterfalls  Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss. Continue eastward towards Vík  Iceland’s southern-most village  where you’ll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach  Reynisdrangar  and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of Jökulsárlón Lake  where icebergs break away from Europe’s largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea. Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe’s mightiest waterfall  Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region  a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall  lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir  and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano. Known as the Capital of the North  Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts  before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland  every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come  and live your own Icelandic story  it’s one you’ll keep telling for the rest of your days.https://www.expedia.com/Iceland.d79.D...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog  Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/,Travel Blogs

1frA2LT8xkk,I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Vlog),I made my Friend a NEW Travel Blog (Puzzlewood Travel Vlog)I love travel blogging I have had a travel blog for 3 years now. It is even in my name... Joe Travel Blogs. But it is always so exciting at the start getting to create a new blog from scratch. It is a chance to recreate your own identity! But the problem is you only get to do that once. SO I decided I would help my friend Jack to create his own travel blog for when he goes travelling later in January. This way he gets a chance to share his travels if he wants to and I get the enjoyment of creating a travel blog from scratch again! Surely that is a win for both of us! Later on in the video we also head off to Puzzlewood for a little travel vlog! In order to get some great pictures to fill out his blog! Keep watching till the end for that :)#nosmallcreater #travelblog #bloggingMy Website:https://www.joetravelblogs.comFollow me here:Twitter: https://twitter.com/joetravelblogsInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/joetravelblogsPinterest: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/joetravel...,Travel Blogs

v_KDI-PGFQU,Andy's National Trust Travel Blogs: Max Gate  home of Thomas Hardy,Max Gate  an austere but sophisticated town house a short walk from the town centre of Dorchester  was the home of Dorset's most famous author and poet Thomas Hardy. Hardy  who designed the house in 1885  wanted to show that he was part of the wealthy middle classes of the area  to reflect his position as a successful writer  and to enable him to enter polite society. The house was named after a nearby tollgate keeper called Mack.Many of Hardy's possessions were dispersed before the Trust acquired the house  but we've furnished the rooms for you to enjoy the spaces he created to write and live in. He wrote some of his most famous novels here  including Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure  as well as much of his poetry.You will find the garden much as it was originally planned  with high walls and large trees encircling the property to preserve Hardy's privacy. The sundial  designed by Hardy  was erected in his memory.-----------------------------------------------------  CREDIT ROLL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WEBSITEShttps://www.facebook.com/AndyWrightTr...Andy Wright Online (travel guru) - http://www.andywrightonline.co.ukTraining the Wright Way - http://www.trainingthewrightway.co.ukThe Wright Inspiration - http://www.thewrightinspiration.comWebsite Designs R Us - http://www.websitedesignsrus.co.ukArcade Software - http://www.arcadesoftware.co.ukArcade Video - http://www.arcade-video.co.uk_YOUTUBE CHANNEL DETAILSAll of my channels are listed here:Andy Wright Travel   https://www.youtube.com/user/soyoukanQigong 4 Health  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3LF...Training the Wright Way  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPIP...Andy's Product Reviews   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZE0...Massive Rant  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL6a...Talkin Really  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxjp..._MERCHANDISEhttps://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/an...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC USE IN MY VIDEOSMusic is licensed (royalty/copyright free) generally via AKM Musicor using Creative Commons Licences.

Xdya8eym9nM,Street Food in Pakistan - ULTIMATE 16-HOUR PAKISTANI FOOD Tour in Lahore  Pakistan!,Thank you to Ali (Pakistan Travel Market): https://goo.gl/VY6NjHSUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos every week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribeT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lAlso  just published a full Pakistan travel guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4I’m very excited to share this first full street food in Pakistan video with you! We started our trip in Lahore  a vibrant  colorful  and packed full of food city. Our first day in Lahore turned out to be a 16 hour street food marathon in Lahore  and it was an amazing day!Get more details on my Pakistan Travel Guide: https://goo.gl/5MHgz4Sadiq Halwa Puri (https://goo.gl/maps/Yoy9dJ6steF2) - We began the day with a very common breakfast throughout Pakistan  halwa puri  but along with chana curry (chickpea curry). We ate off the car  enjoying every bit of the freshly fried puris and curry.Total price - 640 PKR ($4.78)Chacha Feeka Lassi (https://goo.gl/maps/RGQBRQaNj8p) - Next we drove over to Gawalmandi  one of the most legendary areas in Lahore for food. We headed straight to a breakfast staple  the lassi shop and had the most creamy heavy milkshake I’ve ever had  called a pera lassi.Roasted chickpeas - 25 PKR ($0.19) - After exiting an alley  right in front of us was a man selling chickpeas and corn roasted in black Himalayan salt. It’s a very common street food snack in Pakistan.Sweet potato - 80 PKR ($0.60) - Sweet potato is also a very common street food snack in Lahore  seasoned with masala and a type of citrus juice.Baba Kulfi Wala - Next we headed over to Shah Alami Market  another huge and bustling market in Lahore.Kulfi - 20 PKR ($0.15) each - One of the most famous places to eat ice cream in Lahore is Baba Kulfi Wala  and you’ll find a crowd of people standing around the corner of the road eating sticks of their famous kulfi.Orange juice - 50 PKR ($0.37)Chana chaat - 120 PKR ($0.89) per plate - One of my personal favorite Pakistani street food snacks of the day was chana chaat  a chickpea snack. He added in all sorts of spices  chutneys  and seasonings  to create a deliciously refreshing snack.Butt Karahi Tikka Restaurant - Easily one of the most well known restaurants in Lahore is Butt Karahi  specializing in curry made in a rounded pan  called a karahi (we will be eating a lot of karahi’s in Pakistan!). We ordered both a mutton karahi and chicken karahi. Both were amazing  filled with spices and butter  but the tenderness of the mutton was the winner.Total price - 5 600 PKR ($41.84)Siddique Fish Corner - You’ll notice that Lahore seems to come alive at night  and street food is everywhere at night. We began the evening with Siddique Fish Corner  one of the best fried fish stalls in Lahore. It was awesome  and so busy.Total price - 400 PKR ($2.99)Khalifa Balochi Sajji - Another Pakistani dish I wanted to try was chicken sajji  a type of hand rotisserie chicken. The atmosphere and cooking method was incredible.Total price - 390 PKR ($2.91)Khan Baba Restaurant - Finally for our last dinner on this 16 hour day of food in Pakistan  we went to one of Ali’s favorite restaurants in Lahore  Khan Baba. The goat chops were impressive as was the korma curry.Again  massive thank you to Ali  from Pakistan Travel Mart for hosting us in Pakistan  taking us around  and organizing everything.

It also didn't hurt that we had clear blue skies the whole week we were there! The following video will highlight 20 things to do in Lisbon and we hope it will give you a few ideas of some of the sights this beautiful city has to offer. *Our NEW Lisbon guide: https://youtu.be/STAOrE5bfxkGEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/1) São Jorge Castle (Portuguese: Castelo de São Jorge)2) Miradouro das Portas do Sol observation deck3) Carmo Convent (Portuguese: Convento da Ordem do Carmo)4) Portuguese egg tart pastry - Pastel de nata (Portuguese: pastéis de nata)5) Belém Tower (Portuguese: Torre de Belém6) Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Portuguese: Monument to the Discoveries)7) Jerónimos Monastery or Hieronymites Monastery (Portuguese: Mosteiro dos Jerónimos8) Kiosk - Quiosque9) Tagus River Ferry - (Portuguese: Tejo)10) Salmão Grelhado - Portuguese Grilled Fish (Salmon Steaks)11) Visiting Cacilhas Island 12) Lisbon tramway network (Portuguese: Rede de eléctricos de Lisboa)13) Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcântara Observation Views14) Shopping (Rua Augusta)15) Praça do Comércio - Commerce Square)16) Santa Justa Lift (Portuguese: Elevador de Santa Justa17) Bacalhau - Portuguese dried & salted cod18) Tropical Botanical Garden (Portuguese: Jardim Agricola Tropical)19) Lisbon Cathedral: Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Mary Major (Portuguese: Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or Sé de Lisboa) 20) Lisbon night viewsOur visit Lisbon travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts  entertainment  museums  nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.20 things to do in Lisbon  Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle  which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here  and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake  and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head  but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit. Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River  and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture  so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit. A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city  but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square  and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role  it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea. And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon. As always  if you have any other suggestion for travellers of places to visit and things to do around town  feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!This is part of our Travel in Portugal series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Portuguese culture  Portuguese arts  Portuguese foods  Portuguese religion  Portuguese cuisine and Portuguese people.

Jesters Cafe is an Australian franchise that has recently become quite popular in South Korea.  Featuring some of the best pies we've had in Korea  it's no surprise that it can get packed at times with both Koreans and foreigners alike.GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/With branches all over the country it's not difficult to locate one near you. Jesters is famous for its meat pies and various kinds of specialty options (including sweet and savoury). We decided to indulge in our two favourites (Blueberry Apple and Maharaja) which we immediately scarfed down.  The pies themselves aren't overly big but they're very filling and high calories.Although we're English teachers in South Korea  our main passion and projects these days revolve around our online travel blogs that we run.  Our is to transition to becoming digital nomads on the road where we tell travel stories  share travel tips  take travel photos and shoot travel videos.  It's honestly far more work than our teaching jobs entail.  In order for us to become successful  we've been blogging late at night after our teaching shifts and often spending a lot of time on the weekends working on random projects related to our sites that we run together.We show you Nomadic Samuel  That Backpacker  Backpacking Travel Blog and Smiling Faces Travel Photos. Of course  no video of ours would be completed without our quirky bloopers at the end.Overall we highly recommend you visit Jesters if you're in Korea for fast wifi and delicious pies -- betcha can't just eat one!http://nomadicsamuel.com/video-blog/t...You're destroying the pie!Today we are having the blueberry kiss  which is blueberry custard inside of a pie and I've turned it into mush but it tastes amazing.That's a big bite.  It's hot!We're at our favorite cafe in my area.  It is a place called Jesters and it is an Australian style cafe. The reason we've come here is so that we can work on our online projects.  We're both basically digital nomads.  We're teachers right now in Korea but we're transitioning to digital nomads and so every weekend on Saturday or Sunday - one day - we come here often.  We come because we get awesome and fast wifi and delicious pies.Here you have my website 'ThatBackpacker.com" and it is just a random collection of stories and anecdotes and photo essays from my travels.And here is my main site "NomadicSamuel.com" and it is a real quirky travel blog featuring a lot of photo essays  travel stories mostly involving self-depreciating humor involving me doing weird wacky stuff and videos.This other site is called "Backpacking-Travel-Blog.com" this is one that Sam and I run together and we feature a lot of videos that we make for YouTube and just photo essays and planning trips for upcoming travels - that sort of thing.We like to come here early in the morning because the place is empty as they hardly have any customers so we feel like we're at home in our own little space.  Check it out.  It's a nice little cozy environment.  It is nice and bright  which is something we like.Today I'm going to be working on my site  so first I'm just been reading a few comments that people left that I have to reply to those and then I've been in touch with a few advertisers  so I need to reply to them and perhaps write a few articles.  That is what my Saturday entails.  Busy  busy!  Yes.Aside from the things Audrey mentioned I'll be doing a lot of the same as what she is doing.  I also have a lot of social media platforms I'm going to be rocking on twitter  facebook  stumble upon.And the amount of emails in my inbox makes me want to cry.Alright  take three - no take two!Proudly presented by: http://nomadicsamuel.com   http://smilingfacestravelphotos.com   http://travel-photography-tips.com   http://thatbackpacker.com   http://backpacking-travel-blog.com    This video features the song ''Solamente - FrenchLAB" available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Commercial license.,Travel Blogs

35reI2AqbrM,A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger,Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger  but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. In this day in my life video  I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle  but just like the job itself  every press trip is different. This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day  my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos  as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. In this vlog  I used the Canon M50  Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: https://www.alajode.com/blogging-vlog...As always  thanks for watching! I hope you enjoy this insight into a day in the life of a travel blogger - even if there's no such thing as a 'normal' day in this career!#travelblogger,Travel Blogs

Ozi0BCzCRYw,Canary Islands Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean  just off Morocco in North Africa. Formed by volcanic eruptions and shaped by hot desert winds  they are comprised of 7 main islands.When powerful seismic forces lifted these islands out of the ocean millions of years ago  they sculpted landscapes of unimaginable beauty. So spectacular are the Canary Islands that for centuries  it was believed that this archipelago formed the peaks of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.Today  the Canary Islands are a magnet for sun seekers  beachcombers and adventurers from all over the world.With  160 miles of coastline  150 beaches and a climate that feels like it is always spring  the island of Fuerteventura is a perfect place to slow down and relax.A short ferry ride to the west of Fuerteventura is Gran Canaria - a place of ever changing climates and vistas.This island abounds with otherworldly landscapes that have been inspiring visitors for centuries. Take a hike to Pilancones Natural Park. The spectacular plateaus and cool ravines in this area are around 12 million years old. Tenerife  is the largest and busiest of the Canary Islands  receiving around 5 million visitors a year.Or  choose to visit Lanzarote is the Canaries’ easternmost island and is sometimes called the “Island of 100 Volcanoes.”Be humbled by Mother Nature’s destructive power on a tour of Timanfaya National Park. This region suffered a series of devastating eruptions in the 1700s and has remained largely unchanged ever since.No matter which of these magnificent islands you choose  as the sun’s molten rays merge the ocean with the earth  you’ll realise this is a place where Mother Nature and history collide.The mythical city of Atlantis may be a story  lost in the mists of time  but the Canary Islands are only a plane ride away. Whether you are searching for dramatic adventures or a sun-soaked vacation  this archipelago is alive with a powerful magic all its own.https://www.expedia.com/Canary-Island...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog  Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/,Travel Blogs

We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo  Sforza Castle  and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II  but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy  we also tried to prioritize meals  sampling everything from pizza to risotto  and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan  Italy1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)2) Il Duomo Terrace 3) Italian Breakfast - Cappuccino and sweet Italian pastries4) Sforza Castle - Castello Sforzesco5) The Galleria - Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II 6) Risotto alla Milanese - Milan style risotto7) Street Art around Porta Ticinese 8) Colonne di San Lorenzo - Columns of San Lorenzo Roman Ruins9) Boat tour down the canal (linea traghetti gaggiano milano)10) Dine along the canal in Milan's Navigli District11) Aperitivo drinks and buffet - Apéritifs and digestifs12) Shopping in Milan down Via Torino 13) Visiting Chinatown for some Chinese food14) Ride a bicycle in Milan like a local15) Pizza al taglio (pizza al trancio) Italian pizza by the slice16) Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio containing relics of the 3 Magi17) Duomo Museum covering the cathedrals history in-depth18) New City Views with a hop-on-hop-off bus pass19) Museum of Natural History - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano20) Night views of Milan nearby Il Duomohttp://nomadicsamuel.com/photo-essays...Our trip to Milan  Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities  museums  restaurants  arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:Our first stop was Il Duomo  which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan  and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions  including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.For some upscale designer shopping  Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci  who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city’s canal system.Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically  you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture  Italian arts  Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

zRrJcNCgO_Q,35 Things to do in Chicago | Top Attractions Travel Guide,The following travel video is a comprehensive list of the best 35 Things to do in Chicago including all of the top Attractions worth visiting and seeing in this complete travel guide for the Windy City.Many people don't realize this but Chicago is a world class city with festivals  arts  entertainment  dining and architecture that can rival any city in North America or even Europe.  The only other city that I think can compare with Chicago - in terms of attractions - in America is New York. Whether you're scarfing down Chicago style deep dish pizza or taking in a Blues festival you'll find no shortage of things to do in the city. If you're a sport fan there are no shortage of professional teams to follow at any time of the year including the Chicago Blackhawks  Chicago Cubs  Chicago White Sox  Chicago Bears and the Chicago Bulls. When you're thinking of destination to travel to in the United States  Chicago should be near the top of your list.  I guarantee that you'll have a lot of fun:GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/35 Things to do in Chicago | Top Attractions Travel Guide1) Chicago Architecture and Chicago River Walk2) Chicago River Boat Trip3) Kayaking along the Chicago River4) Cloud Gate - The Bean5) Millennium Park6) Pavilion 'Free Shows'7) Art Institute of Chicago8) Watch a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field9) Eat Deep Dish Pizza10) Visit the sky deck at Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower)11) Stroll around the University of Chicago campus12) Check out the Oriental Institute of History13) Marvel and escape the bustle at Osaka Garden14) Enjoy an afternoon or evening at Wicker Park15) Relax and escape at Humboldt Park16) Check out the Dinosaur exhibits at the Chicago Field Museum17) Visit the Shedd Aquarium - the largest indoor one in the world18) Watch a Chicago Blackhawks game at the United Center19) Check out the 'Borders' exhibit at Solti Gardens of Grant Park20) Admire Buckingham Fountain during the day or at night21) View the Chicago skyline from the Hancock Center  22) Spend an afternoon having fun at Navy Pier23) Wander around Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory24) Work out or get a tan at North Avenue Beach25) Laugh your head off watching improv at The Second City26) Test your mind playing the Zombie Game27) Go shopping or people watching along the Magnificent Mile28) Take the Chicago 'El or 'L' CTA metro system 29) Watch an NFL football game (Chicago Bears) at Soldier Field30) Check out the entirely free Money Museum31) Ride a bicycle in downtown Chicago32) Spend time at the Museum of Science and Technology33) Marvel at the architectural wonder known as Robbie House34) Rest your legs by taking a Chicago city tour by Segway35) Check out a performance at Chicago Theatre  We got to see buildings like Marina City  Trump Tower  and Wrigley Building. Architecture river tours are a fun way to take in the sights along the river. If you find yourself here during the summer months kayaking is a popular way to experience the Chicago River. The Crown Fountain is a cool interactive sculpture located in Millennium Park. Art lovers will enjoy the Art Institute of Chicago. Taking in a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley field is a must for anyone who visits the city. You can't come to Chicago and not eat deep-dish pizza! During our week here we ate at many pizzerias in town including Lou Malnati's  Giordano's  Gino's East Side  and Pizzeria Uno. Formerly known as the Sears Tower  Willis Tower is now the 2nd tallest building in the United States. Many of the buildings at the University of Chicago were designed in the Gothic style. which is in Chicago's South Side. For a chance to come face to face with dinosaurs  head over to the Field Museum. Right next door is the Shedd Aquarium which is a popular attraction for families. Visit the John Hancock Center by night as the city really dazzles from the 94th floor. The Navy Pier is a fun place to visit on a weekend including a Ferris Wheel. Chicago's Museum of Science and Technology is the largest science museum. It's hard to miss the flashing lights of the historic Chicago Theatre!

URi_SsPtbhs,How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good  the Bad & the Ugly,How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlogBecoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money  or a decent living of it.A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style  which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.Short paragraphs  easy on the eye  kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link  http://sassyzengirl.com/GuestBloggingGuest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:2) Building a large following  both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger  because there is no potential for them to market their products  hotels etc.http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBloggin...This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEOHo to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article  how to perform keyword research  how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results  especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google.

You are building a business and a brand and that takes time  mastering new skills and iron determination.Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way  because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out http://theplanetd.com - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.But don't worry - they  too  didn't start big  they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can  too.More Digital Nomad Training Videos:Digital Nomad Jobs - https://youtu.be/3MS6Z9KKOMkKindle Publishing - https://youtu.be/k1UddId7Rw8Entrepreneur Bluprints - https://youtu.be/t0727M7iY4cBuild a blog in 10 min - https://youtu.be/iakdyz5RJDINew Bloggers: Start here - https://youtu.be/b9W-8_jy3fIhttp://facebook.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://twitter.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://pinterest.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://instagram.com/SassyZenGirltravelshttp://google.com/+SassyZenGirltravelshttps://plus.google.com/+SassyZenGirl - NEWhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/Luxury-SEOTravel Videos:Australia - Indian Pacific Train: https://youtu.be/QYoC5k9FYz8#howtobecomeatravelblogger#becometravelblogger#travelblogging#travelblogger#travelbloggingcourse#professionaltravelblogger,Travel Blogs
Tbhqw0Ldo_g,Blog #5 First Hummingbird camping trip,Vlog #5. Our first big trip with the 2017 jayco hummingbird.  We had a great time.  The Hummingbird did great and only had one small problem with the jeep  but caught it before it went real bad.  Had some rain hail and a tornado that touched down about 6 miles from where we were camping.  Also I just switched to a new movie editor that I am still trying to get used to so as always if you have any suggestions leave them in the comments and please subscribe,Travel Blogs

poe2cLKw9ko,Montreal Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,Welcome to Montreal  Canada. This extraordinary city  which began life as a French colony in the 1600s  is now a stunning metropolis combining old-world architecture with modern dashes.When Mark Twain visited Montreal in the 19th century  he was so taken by its many churches that he nicknamed it “The City of 100 Bell Towers.” These numerous buildings are often part of Montreal sightseeing; marvel at the imposing stone façade of Christ Church Cathedral  or stand beneath the great arched ceiling of the beautiful Notre Dame Basilica. You can spend days exploring the city’s many sacred spaces  but Montreal tourism is so much more than that; if you’re a foodie  you’re in luck  because the residents of Montreal adore a good meal  whether it’s poutine from a streetside bistro or fresh produce from the farmers market. A tour of Montreal will take you across cobblestone streets and through architecture that dates back to the 1600s  but one thing you must remember to do is to walk and play in its numerous green spaces. The city’s inhabitants take great pride in Montreal’s natural beauty  and hikes up Mont Royal or along the St. Lawrence River are frequent activities for locals. Remember to bring your camera  as the riverfront and the mountain are full of striking photo opportunities.  What is your favorite part of Montreal?Visit our Montreal travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!https://www.expedia.com/Montreal.d178...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog  Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/,Travel Blogs

ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro...The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet  misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough  piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork  dance  and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer  the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain  the city’s iconic peak  and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!After a morning spent in nature  your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana  where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema  or take part in the street dances  festivals  and parades that may spontaneously break out. The “Cidade Maravilhosa ” or the marvelous city  has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?Visit our Rio de Janeiro travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog  Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/,Travel Blogs

R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,Many people daydream about traveling the world  but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav  after traveling the world for years with almost no money  shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same  if they really want to.Tomislav Perko  29  is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker  broke because of the financial crisis  he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling – hitchhiking  couchsurfing  working/volunteering  and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket  meeting the most amazing people on the way.Five years later  he publishes a book “1000 Days of Spring” and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

oVFjA7Qy1as,10 Must Know JAPAN Travel Tips No One Talks about ...like POLICE,These Top 10 Japan Travel Tips are based on what I wish I knew before moving to Japan.  This serves as a Japan Guide for travelers planning Japan travel and what to do when stopped by a Japanese Police officer.  This Tokyo guide also shows what not do in Japan as well as things not do in Japan based on Japanese culture.  These Japanese Travel Tips cover Tattoos in a Japanese Onsen  Non-tipping culture  riding the train in Japan  Wifi in Japan  Japanese Hotels  Japanese Police  etc.  Basically  these are the things to know before going to Japan.  More information is listed below.Check out my Toe-Kyo Shirt Merch here- https://www.zazzle.com/paolofromtokyoFor more Japan related travel info  check out my site- https://www.tokyozebra.comTop 10 Japan Travel Tips You Should Know0:41 #1 Cash in Japan2:38 #2 Eating & Drinking While Walking4:17 #3 Drinking in Japan5:04 #4 Tattoos in JapanTattoo Friendly Onsen - Hot spring facilities in Tokyo - https://www.tokyozebra.com/blog/tatto...6:12 #5 Wifi & The InternetTokyo Wifi Spotshttp://www.wifi-tokyo.jp/spotmap.htmlSIM CARDAnother options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options  but I’ll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  (1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  (2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn’t have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days  you can just buy a new card.

If you want something a little livelier  go a few miles south to check out the Gaslamp District  full of Victorian-era architecture and a thriving bar and club scene. Bringing the kids with you  or looking for a more sedate afternoon? Stop by the San Diego Zoo and spend some time with the many animals taking up residence there – including some of the few pandas outside of China.Explore San Diego’s ties to the sea by touring the U.S.S. Midway  Navy Pier  and Maritime Museum. From there  it’s just a skip across the bay to Coronado  where you can lay out in the sun and soak up some rays in a quiet beach town.

This week we are exploring the city of love  city of lights and city of art. This video will be showing you the top 50 things to do while you visit Paris.So we're wrapping things up here. What would be your one tip for visiting Paris? Well  I have recently spent a whole ten days here in summer. I would say that if you really want to visit the art galleries  the museums and all of the main attractions you should probably avoid summer and like either come in the spring or the fall or even winter. Because the lines are insane and sometimes you have to wait like an hour and a half or two hours.So how about you? What are your final thoughts on Paris? So my finals thoughts is obviously Paris is one of the top cities in the world in terms of attractions. There is going to be garbage  there is going to be lines  there is going to be some areas that are a bit of an eyesore. But there is also a lot of beauty and there is also a lot to do here. And that concludes our guide of the top 50 things to do and see in Paris. We hope you enjoyed watching  and let us know if there are other places you would add to this list. This is part of our Travel in France series showcasing French culture  French arts  French foods & French cuisine.Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network,Travel Blogs

The only Grand Duchy in the world. Over the next few days we're going to be exploring the capital of Luxembourg City and this is going to be a little city guide to show you some of the highlights.Located smack dab in between Germany  France  and Belgium  the little Grand Duchy of Luxembourg can be easy to miss if you're not looking carefully  however  we're of the opinion that this is a beautiful destination that you'll definitely want to make time for. From picturesque neighbourhoods with cream coloured walls  to dazzling views of blue rooftops in the Old Town below  Luxembourg City is a charming destination that you'll want to add to your European itinerary.So this hear is the Corniche and it is a pedestrian promenade which has been called the most beautiful balcony in all of Europe because it gets some spectacular views of the old town. So we are now entering the Bock Casemates and apparently this was the old fortification of Luxemborg and it was known as the Gibraltar of the north.This was once one of the most envied fortresses in all of Europe. Right now we're visiting the Three Towers which are remnants of an old fortress.We've been walking around a neighborhood called the Grund which is directly below the city center. And it is really picturesque and without tourists.So behind me we have Saint Michael's church which is the oldest church in Luxembourg. The first church to be built on this spot dates back to the year 987  however  the church was destroyed  rebuilt  and renovated many times over the centuries. The Palace houses the Grand Duke's office and during the summer months.There is no shortage of museums in Luxembourg City  so we took some time to visit the National Museum of Art and History.We are now looking at the Passerelle which is Luxembourg's very own viaduct. So we are now standing in William Square which is a really popular spot on Sundays and Wednesdays because local vendors setup shop and they sell all kinds of things from fresh produce  to flowers  street snacks.  So final thoughts of Luxembourg. Alright  to wrap things up here it was a really cool city. It is the type of city that you can explore in just one or two days. A weekend type of destination because a lot of the attractions are nearby one another. And we just found it a very easy city to get around in on foot.So as a little travel tip if you're planning on being in the city for a few days we really recommend the Luxembourg Card. This is what we used while we were here and it is really good for public transportation across the city. Across the country actually and you also get access to seventy different galleries  museums  historic attractions and it is not that expensive. I mean it depends on whether you get a family or an individual card but we really recommend it because we made a lot of use of it.Our visit to Luxembourg City was short and sweet  but we hope this video gave you a little taste of what it's like. Now it's your turn: have you ever been to Luxembourg? If so  feel free to share some of your tips in the comments below.This is part of our Travel in Luxembourg series.  We're making a series of videos showcasing Luxembourg culture  Luxembourg foods & Luxembourg cuisine.  Music in this video courtesy of Audio Network,Travel Blogs
